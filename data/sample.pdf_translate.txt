["The Wizard of Oz\nLyman Frank Baum\nPublication:\nSource:Books&Ebooks", "INTRODUCTION\nFolklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have accompanied childhood through\nthe ages, for every well-balanced child manifests a spontaneous and healthy taste for fantastic, marvelous and, quite obviously, imaginary stories. The winged fantasies of Grimm and Andersen have contributed more to the happiness of children's hearts than any other human creation. However, having served for\ngenerations, the fairy tales of yesteryear can now be placed in the \"historical\" section of children's libraries; because the time has come to renew the genre of fairy tales: it is appropriate to eliminate the\noutdated stereotypes of genies, dwarves and fairies, at the same time as all\nthose horrible blood-curdling adventures imagined by the authors in order to\nendow each story with a terrifying morality. As modern education includes the learning of morality, contemporary children seek only entertainment in fairy tales, and happily do without any unpleasant incident. It is in this spirit that the story of the \"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was written, with the sole aim of pleasing today's children. It\naims to be a modernized fairy tale, which, while retaining the wonder\nand joy of the genre, banishes sorrows and nightmares. Chicago, April 1900L. FRANKBAUM\nCHAPTER I: THE CYCLONE\nDorothy lived in the middle of the vast plains of Kansas with her uncle Henry -\nwho was a farmer - and Aunt Em, the farmer's wife. Their house was small,\nbecause the wood needed to build it was lacking in the region and had to be\nbrought from very far away by cart.\nThe dwelling consisted of four walls, a floor and a roof - which\nmade a room - and in this room there was a slightly rusty stove, a\ndresser, a table, three or four chairs and two beds.\n1", "In one corner was Uncle Henri and Aunt Em\u2019s big bed, in another\nDorothy\u2019s small bed. The house had neither attic nor cellar - except for a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone shelter, where the family took refuge during those incredible gusts of wind whose force devastated everything in its path. The shelter was accessed through a trapdoor in the center of the room.\nA ladder led up to the narrow, dark hole.\nWhen Dorothy stood on the threshold of the house and looked all around her,\nshe saw only the great gray plain. Not a tree, not a building stood in the vastness of the flat landscape that stretched as far as the eye could see. The\nsun had baked the plowed earth until it became a gray mass, furrowed with tiny crevices. Even the grass was not green, the sun having scorched the ends\nof the long stems until they had melted into the same inevitable gray. The house had once been painted, but the sun had blew the paint away and the rain had taken care of the rest. Now it was gray and dull, like everything\naround it. When Aunt Em, newly married, had moved in, she had been young and pretty. The sun and the wind had changed her, too. They had replaced the sparkle in her eyes with a note of dark gray. They had taken the pink from her cheeks and lips and turned her gray. She had become thin and emaciated and\nshe never smiled anymore. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, had come to live with\nthem, Em had been so struck by the child's laughter. At first, she even put\nher hand to her heart whenever Dorothy's fresh, joyful voice reached her\nears. Even today, she looked at the little girl with astonishment, wondering what could possibly make Dorothy laugh.\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning to night and did not know\nwhat pleasure was. He too was gray, from his long beard to his simple man's boots. He had a grave and severe air and spoke little.\nIt was Toto who made Dorothy laugh and kept her from becoming as gray as\neveryone around her. Toto was not gray, he was a small black dog, with\nlong, silky hair and little black eyes that sparkled happily on each side\nof his tiny nose. Toto spent his days playing. Dorothy had fun with\nhim and loved him very much.\nThat day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry was sitting on the\ndoorstep and was anxiously scanning the sky, which was even grayer than usual.\n2", "Dorothy stood on the threshold, Toto in her arms. She too was scanning the sky. Aunt\nEm was doing the dishes.\nFar to the north, they heard the wind moan; Uncle Henry and Dorothy saw\nthe tall grass lying down in waves under the swelling storm. Then, they\ndistinguished a sharp whistle coming from the south and turning their heads in\nthat direction, they saw the grass also waving on that side.\nSuddenly, Uncle Henry stood up.\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he said to his wife, \"I'm going to take care of the cattle.\" Then he ran to the stables that housed the cows and horses.\nAunt Em left her dishes there and came to the door of the house. At first glance, she perceived the imminent danger.\n-Quick, Dorothy, she shouted, run for cover!\nToto escaped from Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed. The little girl\nrushed to catch him. Aunt Em, very frightened, opened the trapdoor and went down\nthe ladder into the little dark hole. Dorothy finally got hold of Toto and\nprepared to follow her aunt. She had gone halfway, when the wind\nmade a terrible noise. Then the house began to vibrate so much that Dorothy lost\nher balance and found herself sitting on the floor.\nThen something strange happened.\nThe house turned around two or three times and rose into\nthe air. Dorothy felt as if she were on board a hot-air balloon.\nThe north wind and the south wind had just met at the very spot where\nthe farmhouse stood, placing it exactly in the center of the cyclone. Now, usually, calm reigns at the center of a cyclone, but the enormous pressure of the wind on\nall the sides of the house lifted the latter higher and higher until it reached the top of the cyclone. It remained and was carried for\nkilometers and kilometers, as if it were as light as a feather.\n3", "It was very dark and the wind was howling horribly around her, but Dorothy\nnoticed that things were not going so well.\nThe house whirled around several times. At one point it tilted dangerously and then recovered. But afterward, Dorothy felt as if she were being rocked\ngently, like a baby in its cradle.\nToto, however, did not like the situation at all. He was pacing frantically up and down the\nroom, going from one side to the other, barking loudly.\nDorothy was sitting on the floor, quite calm. She was waiting to see what would\nhappen.\nSuddenly, Toto came too close to the trapdoor that had been left open and disappeared into the void. The little girl thought she had lost him. But a short time later, she saw\none of his little ears reappear from the hole. The pressure of the wind held him up, preventing him from falling. Dorothy crawled to the opening, grabbed Toto by the ear, and brought him into the room. Then she closed the trapdoor to prevent any further accidents.\n\nHours passed and little by little, Dorothy overcame her fear. But she felt alone and the wind blew so much around her that she was deafened. At first, she wondered if she would be blown to pieces when the house came down. As the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and decided to wait calmly to see what the future held. On the swaying floor, she finally dragged herself to her bed, where she lay down. Toto followed her and settled down next to her. Despite the pitching of the house, despite the howling of the wind, Dorothy soon closed\nher eyes and fell into a deep sleep.\nCHAPTER 2 THE MEETING WITH THE GRIGNOTINS\nDorothy was awakened by a sudden and violent shock that, if she had not been\nlying on her soft bed, she could have hurt herself. The suddenness of the shock took her breath away and she wondered what had happened; Toto pressed his\ncold little nose against her face, moaning sadly. Dorothy sat up on her bed and noticed that the house was no longer moving; it was not dark either\n4", "more, for the sun was streaming in through the window, flooding the room with light. She jumped out of bed and ran to the door, Toto at her heels. The little girl cried out in admiration and looked around her, her eyes widening at each wonder she discovered. The cyclone had deposited the house very gently - for a cyclone - in the middle of a country of prodigious beauty. Lovely lawns lay green under majestic trees, heavy with delicious fruit. Superb flowers formed clumps on all sides, and birds with rare and sparkling plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little\nfarther on, a stream gushed along, its waters sparkling between its mossy banks: what a pleasant murmur of voices was, for a little girl who had lived\nso long in the dry, gray meadows! While she was devouring with her eyes\nthis strangely beautiful spectacle, she saw coming towards her a group of strange beings,\nsuch as she had never seen before. They were not as tall as the\nbig people she had always been used to, but they were not\nsmall either. In fact, they seemed about the height of Dorothy, who\nwas tall for her age; on the other hand, from their appearance, they were much older. There were three men and a woman, all oddly dressed. They wore round hats that ended in a point, thirty\ncentimeters above their heads; their edges were decorated with bells\nthat jingled at the slightest movement. The men's hats were blue;\nthat of the little woman, white, as was the dress that fell in folds from her\nshoulders; little stars dotted the material and sparkled in the sun like\ndiamonds. The men were dressed in blue, the same shade as their\nhats, and their well-polished boots were adorned with dark blue cuffs. Dorothy\nthought they might be Uncle Henry\u2019s age, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was undoubtedly much older:\nher face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was almost white, and she walked with a certain stiffness. A few steps from the threshold where Dorothy stood, these\nlittle people stopped and whispered to each other, as if afraid to go\nany further. Then the little old woman came forward to Dorothy, made a deep bow, and,\nin a soft voice, pronounced these words: \u201cWelcome, most noble Enchantress, to the land of the Grignotins.\u201d We are very grateful to you for killing\nthe Wicked Witch of the East and freeing our people from slavery. Dorothy\nlistened to this speech with astonishment. What did this little woman mean by\ncalling her an enchantress and saying that she had killed the Wicked\nWitch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent and harmless little girl; a cyclone had\ncarried her miles and miles from her home; and she had never in her life\nkilled anything. Obviously, the little woman was expecting an answer from her;\nso Dorothy said, not without hesitation: -You are very kind, but it must be\na mistake. I have not killed anything at all. - In any case, your house has, replied the\n5", "old woman laughing, and it comes to the same thing. See! she continued, pointing to a corner of the house, you can still see her two toes sticking out from under that big piece of wood. Dorothy looked and let out a little cry of fright. In fact, just under the corner of the big beam that supported the house, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes. - My God, my God! cried Dorothy, clasping her hands, dismayed, the house must have fallen on her. What are we going to do? - There is nothing to be done, said the little woman calmly. - But who was it? asked Dorothy. - It was, I repeat, the Wicked Witch of the East, replied the strange old woman. For years, she held all the Grignotins in slavery and made them work for her day and night. They are all free now, and they are grateful to you for the blessing. - Who are the\nNibblers? asked Dorothy. - The people who live in this country in the East, where\nthe Wicked Witch was raging. - Are you a Nibbler? - No, I live in the\nNorthern country, but I am their friend. When the Muntchkinz saw that the Witch of the East was dead, they sent me a quick messenger and I ran\nright away. I am the Witch of the North. - Oh, heavens! cried Dorothy. Are you a real\nwitch? - Certainly, replied the little woman. But I am a good witch\nand the people love me very much. I have less power than the Wicked Witch\nwho reigned here, otherwise I would have freed these people myself. - But I thought\nthat all witches were bad, said the little girl, not feeling\nreassured at finding herself in the presence of a real witch. - Oh no, that is a big mistake. There were\nfour witches in all in the Land of Oz; two live in the North and the South, and\nthey are good witches. I know that is true. I am one of them, so I\ncannot be mistaken. The ones in the East and the West were\nreally bad witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is\nonly one Wicked Witch left in the whole Land of Oz\u2014the one who lives in the West. - But, said\nDorothy, after a moment's thought, Aunt Emma said that the witches\nwere all dead\u2014years and years ago. - Who is Aunt Emma? asked the\nold woman. -It's my aunt, she lives in Kansas, the country I come from. The\nWitch of the North seemed to think for a moment, her head bowed and her eyes lowered to the ground.\nThen she looked up and said: -I don't know where Kansas is, because I've never\nheard of that country before. But tell me, is it a civilized country? -Oh yes, replied Dorothy. -Then everything is explained. In civilized countries, I\nbelieve that there are no more witches, nor magicians, nor enchantresses nor\nenchanters. On the other hand, you see, the land of Oz has never been civilized, because we\nare cut off from the rest of the world. That's why there are still witches\nand magicians among us. - Who are the magicians? asked Dorothy. - Oz\nalone is the Great Magician, the Witch answered in a whisper. He has\nmore power than all of us put together. He lives in the Emerald City. Dorothy was\ngoing to ask another question, but at that precise moment, the Grignotins, who until then\n6", "had remained silent, gave a great cry, pointing to the corner of\nthe house where the Wicked Witch lay. - What's going on? asked the old\nwoman. Then she looked and laughed; the dead witch's feet had\ncompletely disappeared and only the silver shoes remained. - She was so old,\nexplained the Witch of the North, that in the blink of an eye she evaporated in the sun.\nIt's all over for her. But the silver shoes are yours and you must wear them. She\nbent down to pick up the shoes and handed them to Dorothy, after shaking off the dust. - The Witch of the East was proud of these silver shoes, said one of\nthe Nibblers, because they hold a charm, but we have always been ignorant of what it is. Dorothy took the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she\nwent out again and addressed the Nibblers: - I can't wait to get back to my aunt and\nuncle, because they'll be worried about me, I'm sure. Can you help me\nfind my way? The Nibblers and the Witch looked at each other, looked at\nDorothy, and shook their heads. - To the east, quite near here, said one of them, lies a\ndesert, so big that you've never been able to cross it. - It's the same in the South, said\nanother, for I've been there and I know it. The South is the land of the Koadlingz. - I\nhave heard, added the third, that it's the same in the West. This country where the Ouinkiz live is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West: she would enslave you if you ventured into her kingdom. - The North is my country, said the old woman, and it is also bordered by the great desert that surrounds the land of Oz. My child, you will have to stay with us, I fear. At this news, Dorothy burst into tears, she felt very alone among all these strange people. Her tears must have afflicted the tender hearts of the Grignotins, because immediately, they took out their handkerchiefs and began to cry, too. As for the old woman, she took off her hat and twirled the tip of it on the tip of her nose, counting: \"One, two, three,\" in a solemn voice. In an instant, the hat turned into a slate, on which one could read large letters written in white chalk:\nWHAT DOROTHEA GOES TO THE EMERALD LAKE\nThe old woman took the slate from her nose and, after reading the inscription, asked: - Are you Dorothy, my child? - Yes, answered the little girl, raising her eyes and drying her tears. - In that case, you must go to the Emerald City. Perhaps Oz will help you. - Where is this City? asked Dorothy. - It is located exactly in the center of the country and it is Oz, the Great Wizard\nI told you about, who is its master. - Is he a good man? asked the little girl, worried. - He is a good Wizard. As to whether it is a man or\nnot, I cannot say, for I have never seen him. - How can I get to his\nhouse? - You must go on foot. It is a long journey through a country sometimes\npleasant, sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all my ma-\n7", "gic so that nothing bad happens to you. - You will not come with me?\n\npleaded the little girl, who already considered the old woman as her only friend. - No,\n\nthat is impossible for me, she replied, but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare to harm anyone who has received the kiss of the Witch of the North. She approached\nDorothy and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead. Her lips, as they touched the little girl,\nleft a round and shiny mark, which Dorothy soon noticed. - The road that leads to the Emerald City is paved with yellow bricks,\nsaid the Witch; so you cannot go wrong. When you come to Oz, do not be afraid of him, but tell him your story and ask his\nhelp. Goodbye, my dear child. The three Muntchkinz gave her a deep bow and\nwished her a pleasant journey, then disappeared behind the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, pirouetted three times on her left heel, and\nimmediately disappeared, leaving little Toto stunned: he began to bark\nvery loudly at her, now that she was no longer there, because he had not even dared\nto growl in her presence. But Dorothy did not feel the slightest surprise; she was\na Witch, so it was normal that she should disappear in this way.\nCHAPTER 3: HOW DOROTHY SAVED\nTHE SCARECROW\nWhen Dorothy found herself alone, she began to feel hungry. So she went\nto the buffet and made herself a slice of buttered bread. She gave a piece to Toto, then took down a bucket from the shelf and filled it with clear, sparkling water from the little stream. Toto ran off, barking at the birds perched on the trees. As she went looking for it, Dorothy saw some delicious fruit hanging from the branches; she picked some, thinking that it would do for breakfast. Then she went back to the house and, without forgetting Toto, poured herself a nice glass of the fresh, clear water, after which she began her preparations for the journey to the Emerald City. Dorothy had only one change of dress; fortunately, it was clean and was hanging on a coat rack next to the bed. She was in gingham, with blue and white checks, and the blue had faded a little from being washed, but she was still very wearable. The little girl washed herself thoroughly, put on the gingham dress and tied her pink bonnet on her head. She took a little basket which she filled with bread from the buffet and covered it with a blue cloth. Then she looked at her feet: her shoes were very old and worn. \"They'll never stand a long journey, Toto,\" she said. Toto stared at her with his little black eyes, wagging his tail, to show that he\n8", "had understood. At the same moment, Dorothy saw on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East. - If only they fit me! she said to\nToto. They are just enough for a long walk, for they must be\nwearless. She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver shoes:\none would have said that they had been made for her. Finally she took up her basket. - On our way,\nToto, she said, we are going to the Emerald City to ask the great Oz how to return to Kansas. She locked the door and carefully put\nthe key in the pocket of her dress. And so it was that, with Toto trotting\nwisely behind her, she began her journey. There were several roads not far away, but she soon found the one paved with yellow bricks.\nA little while later, she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes clicking happily on the hard yellow cobblestones of the roadway. The sun was shining brightly, the birds were singing sweetly, and our Dorothy was not feeling too distraught, for a little girl suddenly torn from her country and dropped in the middle of a foreign land. As she went on, the beauty of the country astonished her. On either side of the road, freshly painted fences of a delicate blue surrounded fields that were full of grain and vegetables. The Muntchkinzes were evidently good farmers, capable of producing abundant crops. Sometimes, when she passed\na house, people came out to look at her and bow to her, for they all knew that, thanks to her, the Wicked Witch had been destroyed\nand they had regained their freedom. The Muntchkinz houses had a strange\nappearance: all were round, with a large dome for a roof, and painted\nblue, for blue was the favourite colour in this Eastern country. Towards evening,\nwhen Dorothy was feeling tired from the long walk and was beginning to wonder where she would spend the night, she came to a house a little\nlarger than the others. Many couples were dancing on the lawn. Five\nlittle musicians were playing the crincrin as loudly as they could, and the people were\nbusy laughing and singing, while not far away was a large table\nladen with fruits, nuts, tarts and tasty cakes and many other\ndelicacies. The people welcomed Dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and\nspend the night with them; it must be said that this was the home of one of the\nrichest Muntchkinz in all the country, and he had invited his friends to celebrate their\ndeliverance from the yoke of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was served by the rich\nMuntchkin himself; his name was Boq. Then she sat down\non a sofa and watched the people dancing. Boq noticed her silver shoes. \"You must be a great enchantress,\" he said. \"Why?\" asked the little girl. -Because you wear silver shoes and you killed the Wicked Witch. That\u2019s not all: your dress has white squares; and only witches\nand enchantresses wear white. - My dress also has blue squares, said\n9", "Dorothy smoothing out her dress. - It's nice of you to wear that, said Boq. Blue is the color of the Muntchkinz and white is that of witches: it's proof\nfor us that you are a friendly witch. Dorothy could find nothing to say;\neveryone seemed to take her for a witch, but she knew perfectly well that she was just a little girl like the others, who had arrived in a strange\ncountry by chance in a cyclone. When she was tired of watching the dancers,\nBoq took her into his house and gave her a room with a pretty little bed. The sheets\nwere of blue linen and Dorothy slept until morning in a deep sleep,\nwith Toto curled up on the blue carpet next to her. She ate a big breakfast and noticed a lovely baby Muntchkin playing with Toto, pulling his\ntail and screaming and crying, which amused Dorothy a lot. Toto was a curious creature to everyone, for no one had ever seen a dog before. \"Is the Emerald City far away?\" she said. \"I don't know,\" Boq said gravely, \"for I've never been there. People prefer to avoid Oz, unless they have to deal with him. But it's a long way from here and it will take you days and days. Our country is rich and pleasant; but you will have to pass through some inhospitable and dangerous places before you reach your journey's end.\" This worried Dorothy a little, but only Oz the Great could help her get back to Kansas; Arming herself with courage, she therefore resolved not to turn back. She bade farewell to her friends and took the yellow brick road again. After a few leagues, she stopped to rest, climbed over a fence at the edge of the road, and sat down. A large wheat field stretched on the other side of the fence; not far away, she saw a Scarecrow, which had been perched on the end of a stake to keep birds away from the ripe wheat. With her chin in her hand, Dorothy thoughtfully examined the Scarecrow. A small sack stuffed with straw served as its head, on which eyes, a nose, and a mouth had been painted, to give it a face. An old blue pointed hat, which had belonged to some Muntchkin, was perched on its skull; The rest of the figure consisted of a worn-out costume, of a faded blue, and similarly stuffed. On his feet he had put on boots with blue cuffs, such as everyone wore in the country. A pie stuck in his back held this mannequin above the ears of corn. As Dorothy stared gravely at the strange painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see him wink slowly in her direction. At first she thought she had been mistaken: in Kansas no Scarecrow winks; but now the mannequin gave her a friendly nod. Then she got down from the fence and approached, while Toto ran around the stake barking. \"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow in a rather hoarse voice. \"Have you spoken?\" asked the little girl, very surprised. - Certainly, answered\nthe Scarecrow; how are you? - Quite well, thank you, replied Dorothy politely; and you? - It's not going very well, said the Scarecrow, smiling, for it's very\nboring to be there, perched night and day, scaring the crows. - You can't\n10", "not come down? - No, this stake is stuck in my back. If you would take it out, I would be very grateful. Dorothy hoisted herself up to both arms and lifted the dummy, which, stuffed with straw, did not weigh much. - Thank you very much, said the Scarecrow, once it had settled on the ground. I feel like a different man. Dorothy was very intrigued; a straw man talking, bowing and following her, all this seemed rather odd to her. - Who are you? asked the Scarecrow, yawning, after stretching himself, and where are you going? - My name is Dorothy, said the little girl, and I am going to the Emerald City to ask Oz the Great to send me back to Kansas. - Where is the Emerald City? he asked,\nand who is Oz? - What, you don't know? she replied, surprised. - Of\ncourse not, I don't know anything at all. You see, I'm stuffed. So I haven't\nany brains, he answered sadly. - Oh, said Dorothy, I'm sorry for you. -\nDo you think, he asked, that if I went with you to the Emerald City, Oz\nwould give me some brains? - I can't assure you of that, she said, but you\ncan always go with me. If Oz won't give you brains, you'll be\nall the worse for it. - That's right, said the Scarecrow. You see,\nhe added on his confidence, it doesn't bother me to have my legs, arms, and body stuffed, on the contrary: there's no risk of harming me. If\nsomeone steps on my toes or sticks a pin in me, it doesn't matter at all, since I don't feel anything. But I don't want to be called a fool, and if\nmy head, instead of having a brain like yours, remains stuffed with straw, how will I ever learn anything? - I understand you, said the little girl,\nwho was really sorry for him. If you want to come with me, I'll ask Oz to do everything in his power for you. - Thank you, he replied gratefully. They returned to the road, Dorothy helping him over the barrier, and\ntook the yellow brick path that led to the Emerald City. Toto, at first, did not much like the newcomer. He growled and sniffed at him as if a\nrat\u2019s nest had lodged in his straw. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Toto,\u201d said Dorothy to her new friend, \u201che never bites.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d replied the Scarecrow, \u201che can\u2019t hurt my straw. Please, let me carry your basket.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a chore for me, for I don\u2019t know how to get tired. I\u2019m going to tell you a\nsecret,\u201d he added, as they walked; \u201cthere\u2019s only one thing in the world that\nfrightens me.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Dorothy. Farmer Muntchkin, who made you? - No, replied the Scarecrow; it is a burning match.\n11", "CHAPTER 4 THROUGH THE FOREST\nAfter a few hours, the walk became more difficult; at this point, the road\nbecame uneven and the Scarecrow stumbled at every step; indeed, the yellow bricks, sometimes broken, sometimes missing, had left holes; Toto jumped over them; Dorothy went around them. But the Scarecrow, who had\nno brains, walked straight ahead, tripped over the holes and fell full length on the hard paving stones. He never hurt himself, however; Dorothy kept picking him up and putting him back on his feet, and each time he went away laughing happily at his misfortune. Now the\nfarms were not so well kept. The houses and fruit trees were few and far between, and the further they went, the more gloomy and deserted the country became. At noon they sat down by the roadside by a little stream; Dorothy opened her basket and took out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused it. \"I am never hungry,\" he said; \"luckily for me, for my mouth is only painted, and if I made a hole in it to eat, the straw I am stuffed with would fall out, and spoil the shape of my head.\" Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she merely nodded her head and went on eating her bread. \"Tell me about yourself and the country you come from,\" said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her meal. So she described Kansas to him,\nhow gray everything was there, and how the hurricane had brought her to\nthat strange land of Oz. The Scarecrow listened attentively and said, \"I can't understand why you want to leave\nthis beautiful country, and go back to that dry, gray place you call\nKansas.\" \"It's because you haven't any brains,\" said the little girl. \"It doesn't matter if it's gray and\ndreary here, we who are made of flesh and blood prefer it to any\nother land, even the most beautiful. There's nothing like her country.\" The Scarecrow sighed. \"Of course I can't understand it,\" he said. If your heads were\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably prefer to live in\nnice places, and then Kansas would be completely depopulated. It\u2019s fortunate\nfor Kansas that you have brains. \u201cWill you tell me a story while we\u2019re resting?\u201d asked the child. The Scarecrow gave him a look full of reproach and answered: \u201cMy life has been so short that I really don\u2019t know anything.\nI was made only the day before yesterday. I don\u2019t know at all what happened in the world before me.\u201d Luckily, when the farmer made my head, he\nstarted by painting my ears and I could follow what was happening. There was\nanother Muntchkin with him and the first thing I heard was the farmer\nsaying to him: -What do you think about these ears? -They are not straight,\nthe other one replied. -It does not matter, said the farmer, they are still ears (which,\nin a sense, was true). Now I will draw his eyes. He painted\n12", "then my right eye, and as soon as he had finished, I found myself looking at it,\nand at everything around me, with curiosity, for it was my first glance\nat the world. \"This eye is quite well done,\" remarked the Muntchkin, watching\nthe farmer paint; \"blue is just the right colour for eyes.\" \"I want\nto make the left one a little bigger,\" said the other. And when the second eye was\nfinished, I could see much better. Then he drew my nose and mouth, but I\nsaid nothing because I did not yet know what a mouth was for. It amused me\nto watch them shape my body, my arms and my legs; when at last they tied my head, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as\ndecent a man as the others. - That fellow will soon scare the crows,\nsaid the farmer; one would swear he was a man. - But he is a man,\nsaid the other. I quite agreed with him. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield,\nand set me on a large stake, where you found me. He went away immediately afterward with his friend, leaving me alone. I did not like to be abandoned in this way; so I tried to run after them, unfortunately, my feet did not touch the ground and I was obliged to remain all alone on my stake. It was a very sad fate, for I could think of nothing, since I had just been made. Crows and birds came in flocks to the wheat field, but\nfled at the sight of me, taking me for a Muntchkin; this pleased me,\nI felt like someone important. Several times, an old\ncrow passed near me; having examined me from every angle, he ended up\nperching on my shoulder and saying to me: \"If this farmer thinks he is fooling me, he is\ngoing about it like a broom. Any sensible crow would see that you are\nonly a mannequin stuffed with straw.\" Then he jumped down at my feet and pecked to his heart's content. Seeing that I was doing him no harm, the other birds came in their\nturn to gorge themselves on wheat, so that in a short time, I was surrounded by their clouds.\nI was saddened by this; after all, I did not make such a good Scarecrow; but the\nold raven consoled me, saying, \"If only you had a little brain in your head,\nyou would be as good as other men, and perhaps better than some of them.\n\nBrain is the only good thing in this world, whether man or raven.\" Then the ravens flew away; I then thought about the matter, and resolved to get some brains by any means I could. Luckily, you\ncame by and snatched me from my stake: and, from what you say, Oz the\nGreat will certainly give me some brains as soon as we come to the Emerald City. \"I hope so,\" said Dorothy, \"very seriously; you seem to be dying for it.\" \"Who are you telling?\" replied the Scarecrow. \"It is so unpleasant to know that one is a fool.\" - Well, said the little girl, let us go. And she handed the basket\nto the Scarecrow. There were no fences by the road now, and the\ncountry was rough and uncultivated. At last in the afternoon they came to a large forest, the\ntrees were so big and so close together that they formed a canopy over\n13", "the yellow brick road. It was very dark, for the branches kept the\nday from breaking through; but our travellers persevered and went on into the forest.\n\u201cIf this road goes in, it must go out,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cand as the\nEmerald City is at the other end, we must follow it all the way.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone could say the same,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cCertainly, and that is why I\nsay it,\u201d replied the Scarecrow. \u201cIf it had taken brains to think of it, I\nwould never have said it.\u201d After about an hour the light gave way to night, and they\nfound themselves stumbling along in the darkness. If Dorothy could not see at all,\nthis was not the case with Toto - some dogs can see very well in the dark - nor\nwith the Scarecrow, who claimed to see as if it were broad daylight. So she took his arm\nand was able to continue her journey without hindrance. - If you see a house\nor any place where we could spend the night, she said, tell me;\nfor it is not at all convenient to walk in the dark. The Scarecrow\ndid not take long to stop. - I see a little cottage on our right, he said, made of\nlogs and branches. Shall we go there? - Oh yes! replied the child. I can't stand it any longer.\nSo the Scarecrow made a path for her through the trees to the cottage;\nas she entered, Dorothy noticed a bed of dried leaves in a corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto at her side, sank into a deep sleep. As for the\nScarecrow, unaffected by fatigue, he stood in the other corner and waited\npatiently until morning.\nCHAPTER 5 THE DELIVERANCE OF THE\nTIN-WOODCUTTER\nWhen Dorothy woke up, the sun was shining through the trees, and Toto had been\nbusy chasing birds around her for quite a while. The Scarecrow\nwas still there, standing, waiting patiently in his corner. \"We must\nfetch some water,\" she said. \"Why do you want water?\" he asked,\nsurprised. \"To wash the dust off my face from the road, and also to\nget a drink, or else I shall choke myself on the dry bread.\" \"It can't be very convenient to be\nmade of flesh,\" said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, \"for you have to sleep, drink, and eat. On the other hand, you have brains, and it is worth putting up with all\nthis trouble, to be able to think properly.\" After leaving the cottage,\nthey walked among the trees and came to a small spring of clear water; Dorothy quenched her thirst there, bathed, and ate her lunch. She saw that there was\nnot much bread left in the basket, and the little girl was grateful to the Scarecrow that she had nothing to eat at all, for they had just enough left to last\n14", "the day, to her and Toto. After having lunch, she was about to return to the road paved with yellow bricks, when a deep moan, not far away, made her jump. - What did I just hear? she asked timidly. - I\nhave no idea, replied the Scarecrow, but we can always go and see. At the same moment another moan reached their ears, which seemed to come from behind them. They turned and took a few steps into the forest;\nDorothy then noticed in a ray of sunlight something shining between the\ntrees. She ran in that direction and stopped with a cry of surprise. One of the big trees was half cut down and right next to it, holding an axe in the air, was a man made entirely of tin. His head, arms, and legs were attached to his body by joints, but he remained perfectly still and seemed unable to move at all. Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and the Scarecrow did the same; as for Toto, he barked nervously and tried to sink his teeth into the tin calves, but only succeeded in hurting himself. \u201cDid you moan?\u201d Dorothy asked. \u201cYes,\u201d the man replied. \u201cYou heard correctly. I have been moaning for over a year, and no one has heard me or come to my aid.\u201d \u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked softly, moved by the man\u2019s sad voice. - Go and get a\ncan of oil and oil my joints, he answered. I can't move, they are so rusty; a good greasing will put me back in order.\n\nYou will find a can of oil on a shelf in the cottage. Dorothy immediately ran back to the cottage and found the can of oil; then she\ncame back and asked, worried: - Where are your joints? - Oil my neck first, replied the Tin Woodman. Dorothy did so, and as it was\nreally very rusty, the Scarecrow seized the head with both hands and gently moved it in all directions until it moved freely; the man was then able to\nturn it by himself. \"Now oil the joints of my arms,\" \u200b\u200bhe said. Dorothy\noiled them and the Scarecrow folded them gently until they were\nall rust-free and new again.\" The Tin Woodman heaved a sigh of\nsatisfaction; then he lowered his axe and leaned it against the tree. \"I feel\nmuch better,\" he said, \"I've been holding this axe up in the air since I\nbegan to rust, and I'm glad to finally be able to put it down. If you'll oil the joints of my legs now, that will be perfect.\" So they oiled his legs until he could move them as he pleased, and he thanked them a thousand times for having thus delivered him, for he seemed to be a very polite and grateful person. \"I should have ended my days in this position if you had not come by,\" he said; \"so you have certainly saved my life. By what chance have you come all this way?\" \"We are going to the Emerald City to meet Oz the Great,\" she answered, and we have stopped at your cottage to spend the night. \"Why must you see Oz?\" he asked. \"I want him to tell me.\" 15", "back to Kansas; as for the Scarecrow, his wish is to get, through Oz,\nsome brains in his head, she replied. The Tin Woodman seemed\nlost in thought for a moment. Then he said: - Do you think Oz could\ngive me a heart? - I think so, answered Dorothy; if he can give\nbrains to the Scarecrow, he can just as easily give you a heart. -\nVery true, replied the Tin Woodman. If you will allow me to\njoin your party, I too will go to the Emerald City and ask\nOz to help me. - You are welcome to us, said the Scarecrow kindly. And Dorothy added that she would be glad to have his company. So the Tin Woodcutter put his axe on his shoulder and they all crossed the forest to find the road paved with yellow bricks. The Tin Woodcutter had asked Dorothy to put the can of oil in his basket. - Because, he said, if the rain catches me and I rust again, I will need it. Fate had done well in giving their group this new companion, for soon after their departure, they came to a place where the trees and branches, inextricably tangled, prevented the travelers from advancing. But the Tin Woodcutter set to work and, with the help of his axe, he soon opened a passage for everyone. Dorothy was so thoughtful as she walked that she did not notice that the Scarecrow had fallen into a hole and rolled to the side of the road. He was obliged to call the little girl to his aid. \"Why didn't you go around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman. \"I don't think enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is stuffed with straw.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the most precious thing in the world.\" \"Have you any?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"No, my head is completely empty,\" answered the Woodman; \"but I once had brains and a heart, too; that's why, after trying both, I much prefer to have a heart.\" \"Why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow. - I will tell you\nmy story, and then you will understand. So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodcutter told the following story: - I am the son\nof a woodcutter who cut down trees in the forest and sold wood for a living.\nWhen I grew up, I also learned the same trade and, when my father died,\nI took care of my old mother until the end of her life. Then I decided to\nmarry, because I did not want to be alone. \"There was among the young Muntchkinz a very beautiful girl; very soon, I began to love her with all my heart. For her part, she promised to marry me as soon as I had earned enough money to build her a\nmore beautiful house; so I set to work as I had never done before. But this girl lived with an old woman, and she would not hear\nabout marriage; she was so lazy that she wanted the girl\nto stay at home and cook and clean for her. So the old woman went\nto the Wicked Witch of the East and promised her two sheep and a cow if\n16", "she prevented the marriage. Then the Wicked Witch cast a spell on my axe, and one day when I was working hard, so eager was I to have my new house and my wife, the axe suddenly slipped and cut off my left leg. \"I felt\nat first that it was a great misfortune, for a man with only one leg\ncannot make a good woodcutter. So I went to a tinsmith and asked him to help me make a white-hell leg. The leg worked very well,\nonce I got used to it; but this remedy angered the Wicked Witch of the\nEast, who had promised the old woman that I would not marry the young and\npretty Muntchkin. I went back to chopping down trees, and again my axe slipped\nand cut off my right leg. I went back to the tinsmith, who made me another leg out of tin. Afterwards, the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other, but I did not let myself be discouraged and replaced them with hell-white arms. Then the wicked Witch made my axe slide, which cut off my head, and I thought my last hour had come. But the tinsmith happened to be passing by and made me a new hell-white head. \"I thought then that I had triumphed over the Wicked Witch, and I worked harder than ever; but I did not know how cruel my enemy was. She thought of a new stratagem to kill my love for the young and beautiful Muntchkin: again, my axe slipped, went through my body and cut me in two. This time again the tinsmith came to my\nhelp and made me a body of tin, and attached my arms, legs, and head of tin with joints, which enabled me to move\nas before. But alas! I had no heart, and so I lost all my love for young Muntchkin; it had become all the same to me whether I\nmarried her or not. She must still be living with the old woman, hoping that\nI would come back for her. \"I was very proud of my body, it shone so brightly in the sun,\nand it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could no longer cut me. The only danger was that my joints would rust; but I\nkept a can of oil in my cottage, and took care to oil myself whenever\nnecessary. One day, however, I forgot to do it, and in the middle of a\nstorm, before I had time to think of the danger, my joints had\nrusted, and I was left standing in the woods until you came to my rescue.\nIt was a terrible ordeal, but in the year that I have been here, I have\nrealized that my real loss was that of my heart. When I was in love, I was the happiest man in the world; but no one can love unless he has a heart;\nthat is why I am determined to ask Oz to give me one. If he will, I will go\nto young Muntchkin and marry her.\" Dorothy and the Scarecrow had\nboth been keenly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and\nthey now understood why he was so anxious to get a new heart. - In spite of everything, said the Scarecrow, I will ask for brains\ninstead of a heart, for what is the use of having a heart when one is a fool? - I\n17", "I will take the heart, replied the Tin Woodman, for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the most precious thing in the world. Dorothy said nothing; it intrigued her to know which of her two friends was right; but in the end, she did not care whether the Woodman had no brains or the Scarecrow had no heart, or whether each had his wish granted, provided she could find Kansas and Aunt Em again. What worried her most was that there was hardly any bread left, or just enough to make a last meal for her and Toto. Of course, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin, much less straw, and she had to eat to live. CHAPTER 6: THE COWARDLY LION\nDuring all this time, Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick groves. The road was still paved with yellow bricks, but\nthey were hidden under broken branches and dead leaves, which made the walk difficult. Birds were few and far between in this part of the forest,\nfor birds seek out clearings flooded with sunlight; on the other hand, one could sometimes hear the deep growl of some wild animal hidden among the\ntrees. This made the little girl's heart beat very fast, for she wondered\nwhat it was; but Toto had understood, he did not leave Dorothy's side for a second and did not even dare to answer by barking.\n-How long will it take us, the little girl asked the Tin Woodcutter, to get out of the forest? -\nI have no idea, she heard herself answer, this is the first time I have been to\nthe Emerald City. My father had once made the journey, when I was a child,\nand he had kept the memory of a long march through a dangerous country,\nwhile recognizing that the region was beautiful when we approached the city\nwhere Oz lives. But I am not afraid of anything with my oil can and we cannot harm\nthe Scarecrow; as for you, you bear on your forehead the mark of the kiss of\nthe Good Witch, which protects you from all danger. - But Toto! said the worried little girl, what has he got to protect him? - It is up to us to protect him if he is in\ndanger, replied the Tin Woodman. As he spoke these words, the forest rang with a tremendous roar, and the next moment a Lion leaped\nuponto the road. With a swipe of his paw, he knocked the Scarecrow off his feet and he fell back on the other side of the road, and then he gave the Tin Woodman a blow with his sharp claws. The Tin Woodman fell to the ground and lay there, motionless, but to the Lion\u2019s great surprise, the tin had hardly a scratch on it. As for little Toto, now that the enemy was there, he ran towards the Lion, barking; the\n18", "big beast was about to bite him when Dorothy, fearing the worst for Toto,\nand feeling the danger, rushed forward and, with all her strength, slapped the\nLion on the muzzle, shouting: -You dare to bite Toto! You should be ashamed,\na big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog! - I didn't\nbite him, said the Lion, rubbing his muzzle with his paw, where Dorothy had\nhit him. - No, but you tried, she replied. You're just a big coward.\n- I know, said the Lion, lowering his head sheepishly, you're not telling me anything.\nBut what can I do? - How do you expect me to know? When I think\nthat you hit a stuffed man like the poor Scarecrow! - Is he stuffed? asked the Lion, in surprise, watching her pick up the Scarecrow and put him\non his feet, while she patted him to get him back into shape. \"Of\ncourse he's stuffed,\" said Dorothy, still angry. \"I\nsee now why he rolls so easily,\" remarked the Lion. \"I was\nsurprised to see him spin around. And the other one, is he\nstuffed too?\" \"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he's made of tin.\" And she helped the Woodcutter to his feet. \"That's why I nearly broke my claws,\" said the Lion. \"When they squeaked\nagainst the tin, I got goosebumps. And that little animal you love\nso dearly, who is it?\" \"That's Toto, my dog,\" replied Dorothy. - Is it made of\ntin or stuffed? asked the Lion. - Neither. It is a dog... er...\nmade of flesh, said the little girl. - Oh! what a curious animal! It seems remarkably\nsmall to me, now that I look at it. You must be a coward like me, to dare\nto attack such a small creature. - Why are you a coward? wondered Dorothea, examining the big beast that was\nwell the size of a small horse. - It is a mystery, replied the Lion. I must have been born that way. Naturally, all the other\nanimals in the forest think me brave, for the Lion - it is well known - is the\nKing of the Animals. I have learned by experience that if I roar very loudly, everything that\nbreathes gets out of my way. I have always been terribly afraid in the presence\nof men; but I only have to roar for them to run away as fast as they can. If\nthe elephants, tigers and bears had tried to attack me, I would have\nrun away, I am such a coward; but at the slightest of my roars,\nthey all run away, and naturally, I do not hold them back. - That is not good\nat all. The King of the Beasts should not be a coward, said the Scarecrow. - I\nknow, replied the Lioness, wiping a tear that was falling from the tip of her tail. It is\nthe tragedy of my life, and I am very unhappy about it. But at the slightest danger, my\nheart begins to beat very fast. - Perhaps you have a heart condition, said the\nTin Woodcutter, you should rejoice, because that proves that you have\na heart. I haven\u2019t got any, so I can\u2019t have heart trouble. \u201cIf\nI didn\u2019t have a heart,\u201d thought the Lion, \u201cI might not be a coward.\u201d \u201cHave you got any brains?\u201d asked the Scarecrow. \u201cI hope so. I never tried to find out,\u201d replied the Lion. \u201cI\u2019m going to see Oz the Great and ask him to\n19", "give me some, remarked the Scarecrow, for my head is stuffed with straw. - And\nI'mgoingtoaskhimtogivemeaheart, said the Woodcutter. - And I'mgoingtoaskhimtosendmewithTototoKansas, added Dorothy. - In your opinion,\nCould Oz give me some courage? asked the Cowardly Lion. - Why not,\nif he can give me some brains, said the Scarecrow. - Or give me a heart, said\nthe Tin Woodcutter. - Or send me back to Kansas, said Dorothy. - In\nthat case, if you don't mind, I'll go with you, said the Lion,\nfor my life is simply unbearable if I'm not given a little\ncourage. - You're very welcome, replied Dorothy, for you're\ngoingtoprotectusfromotherwildbeasts. They must be even more cowardly than\nyou, if they let themselves be frightened by you so easily. - Indeed, said the Lion,\n\nbut that does not make me any braver, and it saddens me to be a coward. Once\nmore, our little group set off again; the Lion strode along beside Dorothy with imposing strides. At first, Toto accepted this new companion badly;\nhe could not forget that he had nearly ended up as marmalade in the Lion's powerful\njaws; but after a while, his resentment dissipated,\nand they soon became a pair of friends. The day passed without another adventure\ndisturbing the peace of their journey. At one point, however, the Tin Woodman stepped on a beetle that was walking along the road, killing the poor little creature. He who would not have hurt a fly felt very unhappy, and as he walked he shed tears of regret. His tears slowly ran down his face, rolled down to the springs of his jaws, which rusted. Soon after, Dorothy asked him a question, and the Tin Woodman did not answer: he could no longer open his teeth. This frightened him greatly; he made gestures to Dorothy for help, but it was no use, for she could not understand him. The Lion was also puzzled: what was going on? But the Scarecrow grabbed the oil can from Dorothy\u2019s basket and\nanointed the Woodcutter\u2019s jaws; the next moment he was speaking normally again. \u201cThat will teach me,\u201d he said, \u201cto watch where I put my feet. For if I happened to kill\nanother insect, I would not be able to hold back my tears, the rust would jam my\njaws and prevent me from speaking.\u201d Then he went on his way with great\ncaution, his eyes fixed on the road, and as soon as he saw the smallest little ant\nadvancing laboriously, he would step over it to avoid hurting it. The Tin Woodcutter knew full well that he had no heart, which is why he took great care never to be cruel or mean to anyone. -\nYou who have a heart to guide you, he said, you never risk\ndoing harm; but I, who have none, must be very careful. As soon as Oz\ngives me a heart, naturally, I will no longer need to watch myself at every\nmoment.\n20", "CHAPTER 7: ON THE ROAD TO THE EMERALD CITY\nThat night, they had to sleep under the stars under a big tree in the\nforest, because there were no houses around. The tree formed a thick roof\nthat protected them from the dew; the Tin Woodcutter cut a big pile of\nwood and Dorothy lit a magnificent fire that also warmed her heart. Toto and\nshe finished what was left of their bread and she did not know now what the\nlunch would be. - If you like, said the Lion, I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you.\nYou can roast it on the fire because you, with your strange tastes, prefer cooked meat; it will make you an excellent lunch. - Do not do that, begged the\nTin Woodcutter. I am sure to cry if you kill a poor deer, and\nmy jaws will rust again. But the Lion went into the forest and\nchose his own meal. No one ever knew what he dined on, for he was\nvery discreet about it. As for the Scarecrow, he found a tree covered with nuts,\nand filled Dorothy's basket with them; these provisions kept her safe from hunger for a\ntime. She was touched by the Scarecrow's thoughtfulness, but\nthe clumsiness with which this unfortunate man gathered the nuts made her laugh. His\npadded hands made him so awkward, and the nuts were so small that he\ndropped half of them beside the basket. But he was in no hurry to fill it, for in the meantime he kept away from the fire,\nfearing that a spark might jump into his straw and turn it into a torch. So he kept a good distance from the flames and only came close to them to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. Warm and snug, she slept soundly until morning. When it was daylight, the little girl washed herself in the rippled water of a small stream, and soon everyone set off in the direction of the Emerald City. The day was going to be eventful for our travelers. After about an hour's walk, they saw ahead of them a large ditch that cut the road and divided the forest as far as the eye could see. It was a very wide ditch; they climbed to the edge and saw that it was also very deep and covered with large jagged rocks. Its walls were so steep that it was impossible\nto go down. For a moment they thought that their journey would end there.\n- What are we going to do? asked Dorothy in despair.\n- I haven't the faintest idea, said\nthe Tin Woodman. The Lion shook his wild mane thoughtfully.\nBut the Scarecrow said: - We can't fly, that's for sure: we can't\nclimb the walls of this chasm either. So if we can't jump over it, we can't go any further.\n- I think I can jump over it, said the Cowardly Lion, after having carefully measured the\nwidth of the 21", "look. - We are saved, replied the Scarecrow, you can carry us all\non your backs, in turns. - I can always try, said the Lion. Who wants to start? - Me, said the Scarecrow: if by chance you could not cross this\nchasm, Dorothy would be killed or the Tin Woodcutter would crash on the\nrocks. But with me, it does not matter, because if I fall, I will not\nhurt myself. - As for me, I am terribly afraid of falling, said the Cowardly Lion, but the only thing to do in my opinion is to try. So climb on my\nback and let us try the experiment. The Scarecrow sat on the Lion's back; the big beast\nadvanced to the edge of the chasm and crouched down. - You don't get a run-up\nto jump? asked the Scarecrow. - No, that's not the way we Lions do it,\nhe replied. Then, relaxing like a spring,\nhe rose through the air and landed safely on the other side. Everyone was relieved\nto see how easily he had escaped; after setting the Scarecrow down, the Lion\njumped back over the ditch. Dorothy decided that it was now her turn, so\nshe picked up Toto in her arms and climbed onto the Lion's back, holding on to his mane with one hand. The next moment she felt as if she were flying through the air, and\nbefore she could say phew, she was safe and sound on the other side. The Lion came back a third time to look for the Tin Woodcutter; then they all sat down for a few moments to allow the animal to rest; for the effort had made him out of breath, and he was panting like a big dog that had run too much. On this side, the forest was dense; it seemed dark and sinister. Once the Lion had rested, they took the yellow brick road again, and each one, in his heart of hearts, silently wondered: would they one day succeed in crossing these woods and\nwould they ever see the beautiful sun again? To add to their anguish, they soon heard strange noises coming from the depths of the forest, and in a whisper, the Lion confided to them that this part of the country was inhabited by the Kalidahs. -\nWho are the Kalidahs? asked the little girl. - They are monstrous beasts with\nthe bodies of bears and the heads of tigers, explained the Lion, and with their long,\nsharp claws they could tear me in two as easily as I could\nkill Toto. I am horribly afraid of the Kalidahs. - How well I understand you, replied Dorothy;\nthese beasts must be frightening. The Lion was about to answer\nwhen suddenly they stopped: another chasm cut off their path; but this\ntime it was too wide and too deep, and the Lion understood at once that he could not\njump over it. So they sat down to think of a solution, and after\nmuch thought, the Scarecrow said: \"Here is a big tree, right by the ditch. If\nthe Woodcutter can cut it down and make it fall on the other side, we can\ncross it easily.\" \"That's a brilliant idea,\" said the Lion. \"Upon my word, you'd think\nyou had brains in your head, not straw.\" The Woodcutter set to work\nat once, and his sharp axe cut into the trunk with all its might; then\nthe Lion braced himself with his big front paws against the tree, and pushed\n22", "all its strength: then, slowly, the great tree toppled and fell with a crash across the ditch. They had only just begun to cross this improvised bridge when a snarling growl made them look up; to top it all off, running towards them, they saw two enormous beasts with the bodies of bears and the heads of tigers.\n\n\"The Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, starting to tremble. \"Quick!\" shouted the Scarecrow, \"let's cross.\" Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms;\n\nthen it was the Woodcutter's turn, soon followed by the Scarecrow. The Lion, despite his certain fright, turned to face the Kalidahs; he let out such a terrible roar that Dorothy began to scream and the Scarecrow fell backwards;\n\neven the ferocious monsters stopped, petrified. But they were bigger than the\nLion; moreover, there were two of them, while he was one by himself: reassured,\nthe Kalidahs set off in pursuit of him. The Lion crossed the trunk, and turned\nto see what they were going to do. Without losing a second, the ferocious beasts were already beginning the crossing. The Lion said to Dorothy: - We are lost, they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws. But stay right behind me, I will fight with them until my last breath. - I have an idea, shouted the Scarecrow. I have thought carefully: this is what we must do. He asked the Woodman to cut off the end of the tree that was resting on this side of the ditch. The Tin Man immediately sprang into action, and at the moment when the two Kalidahs were about to finish their crossing, the tree collapsed to the bottom of the chasm with a great crack, taking with it these hideous monsters who crashed on the rocks. - Well, said\nthe Cowardly Lion, heaving a long sigh of relief, our last hour\nhas not yet come and I am very glad of it, it must be very embarrassing to be\ndead. These creatures frightened me terribly: my heart is still beating. -\nAh, said the Tin Woodcutter sadly, how I wish I had a heart that\nbeats. After this adventure, our travelers wanted more than ever to leave the forest and they were walking too fast for Dorothy who, tired, had to climb\non the Lion's back. To their great joy, the trees became fewer and fewer, and in the course of the\nafternoon they came to a wide, fast-flowing river. On the other\nside of the water they could see the road paved with yellow bricks winding through a land of beautiful meadows, dotted with bright flowers: on both sides, the road was lined with trees laden with delicious fruit. The sight delighted them.\n\"How are we going to cross this river?\" asked Dorothy. \"It's not\ndifficult,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"The Woodcutter has only to build us a raft,\nand we can float to the other bank.\" So the Woodcutter took his axe and\nbegan to cut down small trees to make a raft; While he was busy with this task, the Scarecrow discovered on the bank of the river a tree covered with beautiful fruit. This was a godsend for Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and was able to feast on ripe fruit. But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is a hard-working and infatuated Woodcutter.", "tigable, and when night came, the work was not finished. So they looked\nfor a cozy place under the trees to sleep there until morning; Dorothy\ndreamed of the Emerald City and Oz the Good Wizard, who would soon send her home.\nCHAPTER 8: THE MEADOW OF EVIL POPPIES\nOur little group of travelers woke up the next morning, refreshed and\nfull of hope; and thanks to the peaches and plums that the trees by the\nriver provided, Dorothy breakfasted like a princess. They had left behind\nthem the dark forest that they had managed to cross without any mishap,\neven if, often, they had known discouragement; on the other hand, there now lay before them a lovely, sun-drenched country, which seemed to invite them to go to the Emerald City. But for the moment the wide river separated them from this beautiful country;\nthe raft was almost finished, the Woodcutter cut a few more logs,\nfastened them with wooden pegs, and they were able to set off again. Dorothy sat in the middle of the raft,\nholding Toto in her arms. The Cowardly Lion, when he got on the raft,\ntipped it dangerously, for it was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodcutter sat at the other end to counterbalance it, and,\nby means of long poles, they made the raft move forward. Everything went very well at first; but in the middle of the river the rapid current carried them downriver, farther and farther from the yellow-brick road; and the long poles at this point no longer reached the bottom of the river. \u201cThat\u2019s troublesome,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201cfor if we can\u2019t reach the bank, we\u2019ll be carried down to the land of the Wicked Witch of the West, who will bewitch us into being her slaves.\u201d \u201cAnd I won\u2019t have any brains,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t have any courage,\u201d said the Cowardly Lion. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t have any heart,\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \"And I'll never go back to\nKansas,\" said Dorothy. \"We must go to the Emerald City if we can,\" continued the Scarecrow. He pressed so hard on his long pole that it remained\nsunk in the mud, but before he could pull it out or let go, the raft was\nwrecked and poor Scarecrow was left hanging on the pole, right in the\nmiddle of the river. \"Good-bye,\" he cried to them. They had a great deal of trouble to leave him; indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, and then remembering in time that he\nwas in danger of rusting, he dried his tears on Dorothy's apron. The Scarecrow was in a\nplight. \"I am even more to be pitied than when I\nmet Dorothy,\" he said to himself. I was then perched in a wheat field\nwhere, at least, I could pretend to scare the crows; but what was the use\n24", "a Scarecrow perched in the middle of a river? I shall never have any brains, after all. The raft continued its descent, and the poor Scarecrow was already far behind them, when the Lion said: - We must do something to get out of this. I think I can swim to the shore by pulling the raft after me; you have only to hold on to the end of my tail. So he\nleaped into the water, and the White Hell-Woodman grabbed his tail; then the Lion began to swim with all his might towards the bank. In spite of his great size, he had to make a great effort; but, little by little, he succeeded in tearing them away from the current, and Dorothy took the Woodman's long pole and helped to push the raft towards the land. Exhausted, they at last reached the shore, and landed on the beautiful green grass; but they found that the current had carried them far from the yellow brick road that led to the Emerald City. \"And now what are we going to do?\" asked the Tin Woodcutter. Meanwhile, the Lion lay in the grass, drying himself in the sun. \"We must find the road at all costs,\" said Dorothy. \"The best way is to go along the river,\" remarked the Lion. After a moment's rest, Dorothy took up her basket again, and they went back along the grassy bank to the road that the current had taken them off. What a lovely country, full of flowers, fruit trees, and bright sunshine! If it had not been for the pain they felt for the poor Scarecrow, their happiness would have been perfect. They hurried on; Dorothy stopped only once to pick a beautiful flower; After a while, the Tin Woodcutter cried out: - Look! They all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched on his perch in the middle of the water, looking sad and forlorn. - What can we do to save him? asked Dorothy. The Lion and the Woodcutter both shook their heads, they could find nothing. They sat down by the water and were looking thoughtfully at the Scarecrow, when a stork happened to pass by and, seeing them, came down and landed near them. -\nWho are you and where are you going? she asked. - My name is Dorothy, answered the little girl, and these are my friends, the Tin Woodcutter and the Cowardly Lion; we\nare going to the Emerald City. \u201cThat is not the right way,\u201d said the Stork, twisting her\nlong neck to examine them one by one. \u201cI know,\u201d replied Dorothy, \u201cbut we have lost the Scarecrow and we wonder how\nto get him back.\u201d \u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked the Stork. \u201cOver there, in the river,\u201d answered the little girl. \u201cIf he were not so big and heavy, I would gladly bring him back to you,\u201d remarked the Stork. \u201cHe is as light as a feather,\u201d said Dorothy eagerly, \u201cfor he is stuffed; if you can bring him back to us, we shall be very grateful.\u201d - I will always try, said the Stork, but if I\nfind it too heavy, I shall have to let it go into the river. The big bird flew away and came to the place where the Scarecrow was still hanging on his pole. Then,\nwith its big talons, the Stork seized the Scarecrow by the arm, carried him up into the air, and set him down on the bank where Dorothy, the Lion, and the Tin Woodman\n25", "were sitting. When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends, he hugged them all with joy, even the Lion and Toto; and as they set off again, our joyful survivor sang \"Tol-de-ri-de-oh!\" at every step.\n- I thought I was going to stay in the river forever, he said, but the brave\nStork saved me, and if I ever have any brains, I will find her again to show her my gratitude. - You are joking, said the Stork who was flying after them. It gives me pleasure to help people in trouble. But now I must leave you, my little ones are waiting for me. I hope you find the Emerald City and I hope Oz will help you. - Thank you, replied Dorothy. At that,\nthe brave Stork flew away and disappeared quickly. As they walked, they listened\nto the song of the birds with their bright plumage and looked at the magnificent flowers\nthat formed a thick carpet. They could see big yellow, white, blue\nand purple buds, next to big tufts of scarlet poppies, whose bright colors dazzled Dorothy's eyes. - How beautiful! exclaimed the little girl,\nsniffing the intoxicating perfume of the flowers. - You are probably right, added\nthe Scarecrow. When I have brains, I will probably love them more.\n- If only I had a heart, I would adore them, said the Tin Woodcutter.\n- I have always loved flowers very much, said the Lion. They look so innocent and\nso fragile. I have not seen any so beautiful in the forest. As they advanced,\nthe big scarlet poppies became more and more numerous, and the other\nflowers became rarer; soon, it was nothing more than a meadow of poppies. Now, it is well\nknown that when these flowers are numerous, they give off such a powerful scent that one only has to breathe them to fall asleep, and if one does not move the sleeper away,\nhe will never wake up again. But Dorothy did not know this, and besides how could she have avoided them, the poppies surrounded her as far as the eye could see; soon her eyelids grew heavy and she wanted to sit down and sleep. But the Tin Woodman did not let her. - We must hurry to the yellow brick road before dark, he said. The Scarecrow agreed. So they\nwent on until Dorothy could no longer stand it. Her eyes\nclosed in spite of herself, she no longer knew where she was, and finally fell asleep\namong the poppies. - What are we going to do? asked the Tin Woodman. -\nIf we leave her there, she will die, said the Lion. The smell of these flowers is\nkilling us all. I can barely keep my eyes open myself, and the\ndog is already asleep. Indeed, Toto had fallen down next to his little mistress.\nBut the smell of the flowers did not bother the Scarecrow or the Tin Woodman,\nsince they were not made of flesh. - Run quickly, said the Scarecrow to the Lion, and\nget away from these dangerous flowers now. We will take care\nof the little girl, but if you have to fall asleep, we will not be able to carry you:\nyou are too big. The Lion then stood up and jumped up as quickly as he could. He disappeared\nin an instant. - Let us make a chair with our hands to carry her, said the Scarecrow.\n26", "They picked up Toto and put him on Dorothy's lap; then they made the\nchair, their hands serving as a seat and their arms as armrests, and so they\ncrossed the field, carrying the sleeping girl. They walked for a long, long time, the great carpet of these evil flowers seemed never to end. They followed the river and at last came upon their friend the Lion, sleeping\ndeeply among the poppies. The powerful odor of the flowers had overcome the\nhuge beast, which had collapsed almost at the edge of the field, where the grass was once again unrolling its green meadows. \"We can't help him,\" said\nthe Tin Woodman sadly, \"for he is too heavy to lift. We must\nleave him here, sleeping forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has at last found courage.\" \"I am sorry,\" said the Scarecrow; \"coward though he was, the Lion was an excellent comrade. But let us go on our way.\" They carried the sleeping girl to a charming spot by the river, quite far from the poppy field: she was no longer in danger of breathing in the poison of the flowers; they laid her down gently on the grass, waiting for the cool breeze to wake her. CHAPTER 9: THE QUEEN OF THE FIELD MOUSE\nWe must not be far from the yellow brick road now,\n\nthe Scarecrow pointed out, standing near the girl. We are almost\nto where the river has carried us. The Tin Woodman\nwas about to answer, when he heard a low growl; thanks to his well-\noiled hinges, he turned his head effortlessly and saw a strange beast coming,\nleaping through the grass. It was a large wildcat, all yellow; it seemed to be lying in wait, its\nears pressed close to its head, its mouth wide open revealing two rows\nof horrible teeth, and its eyes glowing like globes of fire. As he approached, the Tin Woodman saw, fleeing before him, a gray field mouse; He\nthough he was heartless, he thought it was very cruel of the wild cat to go after such a pretty, defenseless creature. So he raised his axe,\nand as the cat ran past, he struck it a blow that cut off its head: the beast, cut in two, came rolling at his feet. Freed from its pursuer,\nthe field mouse stopped, then trotted gently towards the Woodcutter and said to him\nin a flute-like voice: - Oh! thank you! a thousand times thank you! you have saved my life! - Please, let's not talk about it any more, replied the Woodcutter. I have no heart, you see,\nthat's why I try to help everyone who needs a friend, even if it's only a mouse. - Only a mouse! the little animal was indignant. Do you\nknow who you are talking to? I am a Queen, the Queen of the field mice. - All\n27", "my apologies, said the Woodcutter, bowing very respectfully before her. -\nIn saving my life, you have accomplished a great feat, and what is more, an act of\ncourage, added the Queen. Then they saw, running, with all the speed of their paws,\nclouds of mice who surrounded their Queen, exclaiming: - Oh! Majesty!\nHow we feared for your life! How did you manage to escape\nfrom the big wild cat? And they bowed so low before the little queen, that\none would have said that they were standing on her head. - It was this funny tin man\nwho saved my life, by killing the wild cat, replied the Queen. From now on,\nyou will have to serve him and obey his slightest desire. - We swear it, replied\nin chorus the mice, in their flute-like voices. But Toto had just woken up; seeing himself surrounded by mice, he barked with pleasure and threw himself into the ranks of the\nfield mice, which were running away in all directions. Toto had always loved to hunt mice, when he lived in Kansas, and saw no harm in it. But the Woodcutter seized him in his arms, while calling the fugitives back: - Come back! Come back!\nToto will not hurt you. Pointing the tip of her snout behind a tuft of grass, the Queen of the mice asked timidly: - Are you sure he will not\nbite us? - I will stop him, the reassuring Woodcutter. Do not be afraid. One\nafter the other, the mice came out of their hiding place. Toto stopped himself from barking, but\ntried in vain to escape from the Woodcutter's grasp: he would have bitten him, if he\nhadn't been made of tin. Finally, a big mouse spoke up: - What could we do to thank you for saving our Queen? - I don't see, replied the Woodcutter. But the Scarecrow, who was racking his brains - in vain\nsince it was stuffed with straw - intervened: - But yes, of course! you can\nsave our friend the Cowardly Lion, who has fallen asleep in the poppy meadow. - A\nlion! cried the little Queen. But he'll only give us one mouthful! - No! said the Scarecrow. This Lion has no courage. - Really? asked the mouse. - At least that's what he claims. In any case, he would not harm any of our\nfriends. If you help us to get him out of trouble, he will treat you with the greatest\nkindness, on my word of honor. - So be it, said the Queen, we trust you.\nBut how are we going to do it? - These mice who call you their Queen and\nare ready to obey you, are there many of them? - Oh! thousands, she answered.\n- Then gather them here as quickly as possible, and have each one\nprovide herself with a long piece of string. Turning to her escort of mice, the Queen ordered them to go and get everyone. They promptly obeyed and ran off in\nall directions. - As for you, said the Scarecrow to the Woodcutter, go and\ncut down some trees on the river bank, and make us a cart to transport\nthe Lion. The Woodcutter immediately set to work; in no time,\nhe made a cart with the strongest branches, including the leaves and twigs.\nHe assembled it with wooden pegs, and hewed four wheels into a stump.\nHe worked so quickly and so well that the cart was ready before the first mice\n28", "reappear. They came in their thousands from all sides: big ones, small ones,\nmedium ones, each holding a piece of string between its teeth. It was then that\nDorothy, waking from her long sleep, opened her eyes again. What was her\nsurprise to find herself lying in the grass, among clouds of gray mice\nwho were watching her timidly. The Scarecrow explained everything to her in detail, then\nturning to the mouse who was standing proudly near them: - Allow me to\nintroduce Her Majesty the Queen, he said. Dorothy nodded gravely, the\nQueen curtsied; the next moment, they were friends. The Scarecrow and the\nWoodcutter had begun to harness the mice to the cart, using the strings\nthey had brought. They tied one end of it to each mouse's neck, and\nthe other to the cart. Of course, the cart was a thousand times heavier than the mice that were to pull it; but when they were all harnessed, they managed to move\nit without much difficulty. Even the Scarecrow and the Woodcutter sat on it, and were thus driven by this strange and small team to the Sleeping Lion. It was not easy to hoist the heavy beast onto the cart. Then the Queen\nurged her subjects to go on, fearing that they would fall asleep if they stayed too\nlong in the poppy meadow. In spite of their numbers, the little creatures\nhad at first a great deal of trouble in shaking the cart and its heavy load. The Woodcutter and the Scarecrow came up behind, and the team began to roll. Soon the Lion found himself in the green meadows, and could breathe fresh air again,\ninstead of the poisonous breath of the poppies. Dorothy came to meet them and\nthanked the mice with all her heart for having saved her companion from death.\nShe had taken a tender affection for the big animal, and was glad to\nsee him safe and sound again. The mice were unharnessed and returned in the twinkling of an eye to\ntheir homes. The Queen was the last to take her leave. \"If you ever need our services again,\" she said, \"go into the field and call; we will run at\nyour call. Farewell!\" \"Farewell!\" they answered in chorus. And the Queen disappeared into\nthe grass, while Dorothy held the turbulent Toto against her, fearing\nthat he would run after her and frighten her. They sat down beside the Lion to watch for his\nwaking; and the Scarecrow went to pick some fruit from the surrounding trees, for\nDorothy's supper.\nCHAPTER 10: THE GUARDIAN OF THE DOORS\nThe Cowardly Lion did not wake up straight away: he had remained among the poppies,\nhe had long breathed in their evil odor; when, at last, he opened his eyes and rolled\nup the cart, he was quite happy to be still wanted. - I ran as fast as possible,\n29", "he said, sitting down and yawning, but the flowers have overpowered me. How did you get me out of there? They then told him about the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death; the Cowardly Lion said, laughing:\n- I always believed that I was strong and fearsome; and yet such small things as flowers nearly killed me and I was saved by such small beings as mice. How strange all this is! And now, my friends, what shall we do? \"We must go on our journey and find the yellow brick road,\" said Dorothy, \"to reach the Emerald City.\" So, when the Lion had rested and recovered, they all set out again, glad to tread the fresh, soft grass, and soon they reached the yellow brick road and set off again towards the Emerald City, where Oz the Great dwelt. The road was well paved and smooth now, and the country around was beautiful; our travellers rejoiced to leave the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had encountered in its dark darkness. They saw barriers again erected at the side of the road; but this time they were painted green, and when\nthey came to a small house, doubtless inhabited by a farmer, it was painted the same colour. They passed several green houses during the\nafternoon, and people sometimes stood on the threshold to look at them: it was as if they wanted to ask questions; but no one dared to approach\nbecause of the big Lion, of whom they were very afraid. They all wore clothes of a very\nbeautiful emerald green and wore pointed hats like those of the\nMuntchkinz. - This must be the Land of Oz, said Dorothy, and we are surely not far from the Emerald City. - Certainly, answered the Scarecrow; here everything is\ngreen, while in the land of the Muntchkinz blue was the favourite colour. But\nthe people do not seem as friendly as the Muntchkinz and I am afraid we\nshall not find a place to spend the night. - I should like to eat something\nother than fruit, said the little girl, and I am sure that Toto is dying of hunger, or almost.\nLet us stop at the next house and talk to the people. When they came to a rather large farm, Dorothy went boldly to the entrance and\nknocked. A woman opened the door a crack and said: - What do you want, my child, and\nwhy are you walking around with that big terrible Lion? - We would like to spend the night at your house, if you will allow us, replied Dorothy; as for the Lion,\nhe is my friend and would not harm you for anything in the world. - Is he tamed?\nasked the woman, opening the door a little wider. - Oh yes, said the little girl,\nand he is also a great coward: he will be more afraid of you than you are of him. - Well, said the\nwoman after thinking and casting another furtive glance at the Lion, in that case you\ncan come in; I will give you something to eat and a place to sleep. They all\nentered the house, where there were two children and a man. The man\nhad injured his leg and was lying on the bed in a corner. They seemed rather surprised to see such a strange company, and while the woman was putting\n30", "the table, the man asked\n- Where are you all going like that? - To the Emerald City, said Dorothy, to see Oz\nthe Great. - Oh really? exclaimed the man. Are you sure Oz will receive you? -\nWhy not? she replied. - They say he admits no one into his presence. I\nhave often been to the Emerald City, it is a place of marvelous beauty;\nbut I have never been allowed to see Oz the Great, and to my knowledge, no\nliving being has ever managed to see him. - But he never goes out? asked the Scarecrow. - Never. Day after day he sits in the great Throne Room of his palace, and even\nthose who serve him have never come face to face with him. - What is he like?\nasked the little girl. \"That is hard to say,\" answered the thoughtful man. \"You see, Oz is a great Wizard and can take any form he pleases. For example, to some he looks like a bird, to others like an elephant, to others like a cat. To some he has the features of a beautiful fairy or a goblin, or takes any other form he pleases. But who is the real Oz, and when does he show his true face, one cannot tell.\" \"How strange,\" said Dorothy, \"but we must try somehow to meet him, or else we shall have undertaken our journey for nothing.\" \"Why do you wish to see Oz the Terrible?\" - I want him to\ngive me some brains, said the Scarecrow, feverishly. - Oz could arrange that\neasily enough, said the man. He has more brains than he needs. - And I\nwant him to give me a heart, said the Tin Woodman. - That would not embarrass him, continued the man, for Oz has a large collection of hearts of\nall sizes and shapes. - And I want him to give me courage, said the Cowardly Lion. - Oz keeps a large jar of courage in his Throne\nRoom; he has covered it with a gold saucer to prevent it from escaping. He will be\nhappy to give it to you. - And I want him to send me back to Kansas, said Dorothy. -\nWhere is Kansas? asked the man with a surprised air. - I don't know, answered Dorothy sadly, but it is my country and I am sure it is somewhere.\n- Probably. You know, Oz can do anything; he will find you Kansas, I\nsuppose. But first you must succeed in seeing him, and that will be difficult: for the great\nMagician does not like to see anyone, and generally it is he who decides. And you, what do you want? he continued, addressing Toto. Toto, himself, was content to wag his tail; for, strange to say, he did not know how to speak. The woman announced to them that supper was ready, so they sat down around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge, some scrambled eggs, a plate of beautiful white bread, and found her meal very good. The Lion tasted the porridge, but he didn\u2019t like it, saying that it was made of oats, and that oats were good for horses, not lions. As for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, they didn\u2019t eat a mouthful. Toto tasted a little of everything and found his supper to be good again. The woman then made a bed for Dorothy, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion stood guard at the door.\n31", "from his room. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood in\na corner and remained quiet all night, but without sleeping, of course. The\nnext morning, as soon as the sun rose, they set off again and soon saw\nin the sky, just in front of them, a magnificent green light. \"It must be the\nEmerald City,\" said Dorothy. The closer they got, the brighter the light became, and they already thought they had reached\nthe goal. However, it was only in the afternoon that they reached the rampart that surrounded the City. It was a thick wall, quite high and\nof a bright green. The road paved with yellow bricks ended just at the great gate all encrusted with emeralds which, in the sun, threw such a light that even the Scarecrow\u2019s painted eyes were dazzled. Beside the gate there was a bell; Dorothy pressed the button and could hear a silvery tinkling. Then the enormous gate slowly pivoted on itself, they all went through it and found themselves under a great vault whose walls sparkled with their innumerable emeralds. . In front of them was a little man the same size as the Muntchkinz. He was dressed all in green, from head to foot, and even his skin had something greenish about it. Beside him was a big box. On\nseeing Dorothy and her companions, the man asked: - What do you desire\nin the Emerald City? - We have come here to meet Oz the Great,\nsaid Dorothy. The man was so surprised by the answer that he had to sit down\nto think. - I have been asked for years to see Oz,\nsaid he, shaking his head in a perplexed manner. He is powerful and\nterrible, and if the object of your visit is trivial or ridiculous, and risks disturbing the meditations of the Great Magician, he can\nannihilate you all in an instant. - But the object of our visit is neither ridiculous nor\nfutile, replied the Scarecrow; it is important; and we have heard that Ozis\na good Magician. - Certainly, said the green man, and he governs the Emerald\nCity with wisdom. But he is merciless towards those who are ill-intentioned\nor too curious, and very few have dared to ask to see him face to face. I am the Guardian\nof the Gates, and since you want at all costs to meet Oz the Great, my duty\nis to lead you to his Palace. But first you must wear\nglasses. -Why? asked Dorothy. -Because, if you did not wear glasses, you would be dazzled by the brilliance and splendor of the Emerald City. Even\nthose who live in the City must wear glasses day and night. They all lock; Ozena decided so when the City was built and I have the only\nkey that can open them again. He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was full of glasses of all sizes and shapes. Their lenses were\nall green. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair exactly the size of Dorothy and put them on her. They were held behind her head by\ntwo gold cords, looped together by means of a small key that the Guardian\nwore on his neck. Once put on, Dorothy could not have taken them off, even if she\nhad wanted to; but as she had no desire to be blinded by the glare of\n32", "the Emerald City, she was silent. Then the green man found glasses that fit the\nScarecrow, the Woodcutter, and the Lion; he even got a pair for Toto, and he\ngave them all a good turn of the key. Then the Gatekeeper put on his own glasses and\nindicated that he was ready to show them the way to the Palace. He took a big gold\nkey from the wall to open another door, and after going through\nthe gate together, they followed him into the streets of the Emerald City.\nCHAPTER 11: THE MARVELOUS EMERALD\nCITY\nIn spite of their green glasses, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by\nthe brilliance of the Marvelous City. The streets were lined with splendid houses,\nall of green marble and inlaid with sparkling emeralds. They walked on a pavement of the same marble, and the joints of the flagstones were set with close rows of emeralds that glittered in the sun. The panes in the windows were green, the sky above the City had a green hue, and the sun itself cast green rays. Many people were walking in the streets, men, women, and children; all were dressed in green and had greenish complexions. They stared in astonishment at Dorothy and her strange escort, the children ran to hide behind their mothers at the sight of the Lion; but no one spoke to them. There were many shops, and Dorothy noticed that everything was green inside. Everything they sold was green: the candy and popcorn, the shoes, the hats, and the clothes. In a shop a man was selling green lemonade, and Dorothy saw that the children were paying with green pennies. There seemed to be no horses or animals of any kind; the men were carrying various things in little green carts that they pushed before them. Everyone looked happy and contented, and everyone breathed prosperity. The Gatekeeper led them through the streets to the center of the City, where there stood a large building, the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. A soldier was on duty in front of the gate, in a green uniform and with a long green beard. \"These are strangers,\" said the Gatekeeper, \"they insist on meeting Oz the Great.\" \"Come in,\" said the soldier, \"I will take your message to him.\" They passed\nthrough the gates of the Palace and were ushered into a large room covered\nwith a green carpet and whose green furniture was decorated with emeralds. The soldier\nasked them to wipe their feet on a green mat before entering this room, and\nwhen they were seated, he said politely: - Make yourselves comfortable while I\ngo to the door of the Throne Room, to inform Oz of your presence. The soldier\n33", "remained absent for a long time. When at last he returned, Dorothy asked: - Have you\nseen Oz? - Oh no, said the soldier, I have never seen him. But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he would grant you an audience if you wished, but each of you must appear before him alone and he will only accept one a day. Therefore, since you must stay at the Palace for several days, I will\nhave you taken to your house at night to make his joints work to make sure\nthat they were still in good working order. The Lion, himself, would have preferred\na bed of dry leaves in the forest, and did not much like being shut up in a\nroom; but he was too sensible to let himself be bothered by this detail: he therefore jumped\nupon the bed and, curling up like a cat, fell asleep purring, in the time it takes to tell. The next morning after breakfast, the green maid came to fetch Dorothy; she put on one of the prettiest\ngreen dresses\u2014it was made of green brocade satin\u2014Dorothy put on a green silk apron\nand tied a green ribbon around Toto\u2019s neck, and they went to the\nThrone Room of Oz the Great. They passed through a large antechamber filled with\na crowd of ladies and courtiers, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had\nnothing to do but talk; but every morning they had to wait outside the\nThrone Room, and yet they had never been allowed to see\nOz. When Dorothy came in, they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered, \u201cDo you really intend to see the face of Oz the Dreadful?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said the girl, \u201cif he will see me.\u201d - Oh, he agrees to receive you, said the soldier, who had conveyed his message to the Magician, and yet he does not like to be asked for an interview. Besides, he first became angry, and told me that I should send you back to where you came from. Then he asked me how you were, and when I alluded to your silver shoes, he showed great interest. Finally, I told him about that mark you bear on your forehead, and he decided to admit you into his presence. At the same moment, a bell was heard, and the green servant said to Dorothy: - Here is the signal. You must enter the Throne Room alone. She opened a small door; Dorothy boldly stepped through it and found herself in a wonderful place. The room was large and round, with a high domed ceiling, covered, as well as the walls and floor, with enormous emeralds set side by side. An intense light, as bright as that of the sun, fell from the center of the dome on the emeralds. But Dorothy's eyes were dazzled by the great throne of green marble in the center of the room. It was shaped like a chair and was studded with precious stones, like everything else. In the middle of the seat sat an enormous Head without body, arms, or legs. There was not a hair on this head, which nevertheless had eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and the head of the largest of giants would have seemed small in comparison. As Dorothy could not take her eyes off this spectacle in an emer- 34", "mingled with fear, the eyes began to turn slowly and stare at her\ncarefully. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say\nthese words: \"I am Oz, the Great and the Dreadful. Who are you, and what do you want of me?\" She expected to hear a more dreadful voice come from the enormous Head; this gave her courage, and she answered: \"My name is Dorothy, the Humble\nand the Obedient. I have come to ask you to help me.\" The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then the voice added: \"Where did you get\nthe silver shoes?\" \"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, who killed my house by falling on them,\" she replied. \"Where did the mark on your forehead come from?\" the voice continued. \u201cThat\u2019s where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she said good-bye to you,\u201d said the girl. The\neyes looked at her again, and they saw that she was telling the truth. Then Oz asked, \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d \u201cSend me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\u201d she answered seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t like your country, and yet it\u2019s a beautiful place. I\u2019m sure Aunt Em is worried sick about my long absence.\u201d The eyes blinked three times, then turned to the ceiling, dropped to the floor, and rolled in such a strange way that they seemed to sweep the whole room. Finally they came back to rest on Dorothy. \u201cWhy should I do you this favor?\u201d asked Oz. - Because\nyou are strong and I am weak, because you are a great Wizard and\nI am only a helpless little girl. - But you had the strength\nto kill the Wicked Witch of the East, said Oz. - It happened all by itself, replied Dorothy quite simply. I could not prevent it. - Well, said the Head, I will\ngive you my answer. You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas if you do not do something for me in return. In this country, nothing is\nfree for anyone. If you want me to use my magic power to send you home, you must first do something for\nme. Help me and I will help you. - What should I do? asked the little girl. - Kill the\nWicked Witch of the West, answered Oz. - But I can't, exclaimed\nDorothy, in the height of surprise. - You have killed the Witch of the East, and\nyour silver shoes have magic power. There is only one Wicked Witch left in the\nwhole country; the day you tell me she is dead, I will send you back to\nKansas, but not before. The little girl began to cry, so disappointed\nshe was; her eyes blinked again and gave him a worried look, as if Oz\nthe Great thought it depended on her will to help her. - I have never killed\nanything voluntarily, she said in a sob, and even if I wanted to, how\ncould I kill the Wicked Witch? If you can't kill her yourself,\nyou who are Great and Dreadful, how could I do it, me? -\nI don't know, said the Head, but that is my answer, and you will not see your uncle\nand your aunt again until the Wicked Witch is dead. This witch is\n35", "perverse, terribly perverse, do not forget it, and you must kill it. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have completed your task. Dorothy left the Throne Room with a heavy heart, and went to join the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Woodcutter, who were eager to hear what Oz had said to her. \"All hope is lost for me,\" she said, \"for Oz refuses to send me home unless I kill the Wicked Witch of the West, and I can never do such a thing.\" Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing for her, so she went back to her room, lay down on the bed, and, thinking so much, finally fell asleep. The next morning, the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said to him: - Follow me, Oz sent me to fetch you. The Scarecrow followed him\nand was ushered into the great Throne Room where he saw, seated on the throne\nof emeralds, a most ravishing lady. She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore, on her curly green hair, a crown of jewels.\nFrom her shoulders came wings with splendid reflections and so light that they quivered at the slightest breath. Before this beautiful person, the Scarecrow made a\ngraceful curtsy, as much as one can do when one is stuffed with straw; then\nshe looked at him kindly and said: - I am Oz, the Great and the Dreadful. Who\nare you, and what do you want of me? Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the\nhuge Head that Dorothy had spoken of, was overwhelm-\ned with astonishment; nevertheless he\nfound the courage to answer her: - I am only a Scarecrow stuffed with straw.\nThat is why I have no brains, and I have come to beg you to put\na little in my head, so that I may become a man like all those in your\nkingdom. - Why should I do it? asked the Lady. - Because you are wise and\npowerful, and you alone can help me, answered the Scarecrow. - I never grant\na favor without some service in return, said Oz; but I am willing to promise this. If you will kill the Wicked Witch of the West for me,\nI will give you a good deal of brains, and of such good quality that\nyou will be the wisest man in all the land of Oz. - But did you not ask\nDorothy to kill the Witch? said the Scarecrow in astonishment. - That is true. I do not care who kills her. But I will not grant your wish until she has been destroyed.\nNow go and do not seek to see me again until you have earned what you so ardently desire. The Scarecrow, very grieved, went to his friends and reported to them the words of Oz; Dorothy was very surprised to learn\nthat the great Wizard was not a Head, but a beautiful Lady.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cshe would need a heart as much as the Woodcutter.\u201d The next day, the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Woodcutter and said, \u201cOz has sent for me, follow me.\u201d The Woodcutter did so, arriving in front of the great Throne Room. He did not know whether he was going to see Oz in the form of a beautiful Lady or a Head, but he would have preferred the beautiful Lady. \u201cFor,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cif it is the Head, I am sure I shall not get a heart, since a head has no heart and cannot com-\n36", "takemydesire. But ifsheistheLady,Iwilltrytosoftenher,theysaythat\nladieshavetenderhearts.\" But, upon entering the great Throne Room, the\nWoodswomansawneitherHeadnorLady: OzhadtakentheformofaterrifyingBeast. Shewasalmostthesizeofanelephant;onewouldwonderifthegreenthronecouldsupportherweight. Shehadtheheadofarhinocerosbutwasgivenfiveeyes. Fivegreatarmscameoutfromherbody,whichwasalsogivenfivelegs,longandthin. Herentirebodywascoveredwiththickandwoolyhair,\nandonecouldnotimagineamorefrighteningmonster. Fortunately for the Woodcutter, he did not yet have a heart, for the Woodcutter would have been mad with terror. But\nas he was only made of tin, the Woodcutter did not feel the slightest fear;\non the other hand, his disappointment was great. - I am Oz, the Great and the Fearsome, roared the Beast. Who are you and what do you want from me? - I am a Tin Woodcutter. So I have no heart and cannot love. I beg you to give me\na heart so that I may be like other men. - Why should I? asked the Beast in a haughty tone. - Because I ask you, and you alone can\ngrant me, replied the Woodcutter. Oz received these words with a low growl\nbut added gruffly: - If you really want a heart, you must deserve it. -\nIn what way? asked the Woodcutter. - Help Dorothy kill the Wicked Witch of the West, replied the Beast. Once the Witch has been destroyed, come and find me and at that moment, I will give you the biggest, most tender\nand most affectionate heart in all the land of Oz. So our Tin Woodcutter had\nnothing left to do but return all sorrow to his friends and tell them about his interview\nwith the terrible Beast. They marveled that the great Wizard could take all\nthese forms, and the Lion said: - If he appears to me in the form of a Beast, I will roar with\nall my might and I will frighten him so much that he will grant all my wishes. If\nit is in the form of the beautiful Lady, I will pretend to jump on him and I will thus force him\nto carry out my wish. If it is the great Head, it will be at my mercy, for I will make it roll all\nover the room until she promises to satisfy us. Courage, my friends, for everything will be alright. The next morning, the soldier with the green favorites led the Lion to the great Throne Room and stepped aside to let him in.\nThe Lion immediately went through the door, looked around him and, to his great surprise, saw before the throne a Ball of Fire, of a light so cruel that he could hardly bear it. At first he thought that Oz had caught fire by accident and was finishing\nconsuming himself: but when he tried to approach, the intense heat singed his whiskers and, crawling, he returned to the door, trembling in all his limbs.\nThen, a calm voice came from the Ball of Fire and pronounced these words: - I am Oz,\nthe Great and the Dreadful. Who are you and what do you want from me? The Lion answered: - I am a Cowardly Lion, and anything frightens me. I come to beg you to give me\ncourage to deserve the title of Animal King, which all men\naward me. - Why should I give you courage? asked Oz. - Because\n37", "that of all the Magicians you are the greatest and you alone have the power\nto grant my wish, replied the Lion. The Fireball blazed for a moment and the\nvoice continued: - Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch has been destroyed, then\nI will give you courage; but as long as she lives, you will remain a coward.\nThis speech angered the Lion, who found nothing to answer; dazed, he contemplated\nthe Fireball: it began to glow, he turned around and left the room, belly to the\nground. He was happy to find himself among his friends and told them about his terrible\ninterview with the Magician. - And now, what are we going to do? asked\nDorothy sadly. - The only thing we have to do, replied the Lion, is to go\nto the land of the Yinkiz, and to seek out the Wicked Witch\nand destroy her. - And if we can't? said the little girl. - Then I shall never have\ncourage, declared the Lion. - And I shall never have brains, added the Scarecrow. - And I shall never have a heart, said the Tin Woodman. - And I shall\nnever see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry again, said Dorothy, beginning to cry.\n- Be careful, cried the green servant, your tears will stain your green silk dress.\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, \"I think we must try, but I\ndon't want to kill anyone, even to see Aunt Em again.\" \"I'll go with you,\nbut I'm too cowardly to kill the Witch,\" said the Lion. \"I'll come too,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I can't be of much use to you, I'm so\nsilly.\" \"I haven't the heart to hurt even a Witch,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"but if you're going, then I'm one of you.\" So it was decided that they should set out in the morning; the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green\nmillstone and had all his joints oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw, and Dorothy painted his eyes so that he could see better. The maid, who had been very kind to them, filled Dorothy\u2019s basket with\ntreats and tied a green ribbon with a bell around Toto\u2019s elbow. They went to bed very early and slept soundly until dawn; they were awakened\nby the crowing of a green rooster that lived in the courtyard of the palace and the cackling\nof a hen that had just laid a green egg.\nCHAPTER 12: IN SEARCH OF THE WICKED\nWITCH\nThe soldier with the green sideburns led them back through the streets of the Emerald\nCity, to the post of the Gatekeeper. This officer took off their glasses to put them\nback in his big box, then very courteously opened the door to our friends. - Which way do we go to the Wicked Witch of the West? asked Dorothy. - He\n38", "there is no road, replied the Guardian; no one has ever tried to go\nthat way. - So how will we find it? the little girl wondered. - It will be easy, replied the man; as soon as the Witch knows that\nyou are among the Ouinkiz, she will find you and make you her slaves. - Not\nso sure, intervened the Scarecrow. We intend to eliminate her. - In\nthat case, that changes everything, said the Guardian of the Gates. No one has ever tried to\ndestroy her, that is why I thought she would enslave you, like the\nothers. But be careful, she is cruel and evil, she will not let herself be\ndestroyed easily. Always go towards the West, towards the setting sun, you\nwon't risk missing her. They thanked him and bade him farewell, then\nset off westward, through meadows brightened here and there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had\nbeen given at the palace, but to her great surprise, the dress was no longer green but\nimmaculately white. And like Dorothy\u2019s dress, the ribbon tied at Toto\u2019s\nelbow had also lost its green colour. The Emerald City was soon far\nbehind them. Gradually the ground became rough and uneven, there were neither farms nor houses in the\nWestern country, and the land was left fallow. Under the\nhot afternoon sun, no tree offered them shade and coolness; well before nightfall, Dorothy, Toto and the Lion lay down in the\ngrass and fell asleep immediately, watched over by the Woodcutter and the Scarecrow. Now, the\nWicked Witch of the West had only one eye, but an eye as powerful as a\ntelescope, capable of taking in the whole expanse of the country. So, as\nshe was sitting on the steps of her castle, peering around, her sight fell\nby chance on Dorothy sleeping among her companions. They were\na great distance away, but the presence of these intruders greatly angered the Wicked Witch; she took a silver whistle from her neck, and whistled: from all\nthe horizons came running great wolves, with long legs, cruel eyes, and sharp fangs. - Run and tear these people to pieces for me, ordered the Witch. -\nWon't you make them your slaves? asked the leader of the horde. - What's the point? she answered. A man made of tin, the other of straw, a little girl, and\na Lion, good-for-nothings in short. You can tear them to pieces. - Very\nwell, said the Wolf, and he rushed forward, his pack on his heels. Fortunately, the Scarecrow and the Woodcutter were wide awake; they heard the wolves approaching. - I'll take care of it, said the Woodcutter; get behind me, I'll receive them.\n\nHe took his axe with its sharp edge; when the leader of the band came within reach, he brandished his weapon and cut off the wolf's head cleanly, which died instantly. A\nscarcely had he raised his arm when another assailant rushed at him; the Woodcutter felled him\nwith the same surety. Forty wolves attacked him, forty times the woodcutter's weapon did its work, so that at the last blow, the dead piled up in a\ngreat heap before the Woodcutter. Then he lowered his axe and came to sit down beside\n39", "the Scarecrow who said, admiringly: - A fine fight, my friend! And they waited for\nDorothy to wake up. The next morning, the little girl was really frightened at the sight\nof this mountain of wolves with shaggy hair, but the Tin Woodcutter told her about the\nbattle. She thanked him for having saved them, and after breakfast, they set off again. Now that same morning, the Wicked Witch came to the threshold of her\ncastle and scanned the horizon with her single eye, as far as her sight could reach. She saw her wolves, lying decapitated, while the strangers continued\ntheir journey through the country. More furious than ever, she seized her silver whistle and blew two blasts. Immediately, a flock of crows darkened the\nsky and came to swoop down at her feet. The Witch spoke to their King: - Fly immediately towards these strangers; gouge out their eyes and tear them to pieces. The flock of\nwild crows set off again in the direction of Dorothy and her companions. The little girl\nwas frightened when she saw them coming, but the Scarecrow declared: - This time, it is up to me.\nLie down on the ground behind me, you will not risk being\nhurt. All of them lay down on the ground, except the Scarecrow who straightened up,\nspreading his arms. At the sight of him, the crows stopped, frightened: usually, these\nbirds do not dare to approach scarecrows. But the King of the crows\nsaid to them: - It is only a straw mannequin. I will gouge out his eyes. He rushed\nat the Scarecrow, but the latter seized him by the head, and wrung his neck until\nhe was dead. Another raven attacked him in turn; the Scarecrow wrung his neck just as\ncalmly. Forty ravens attacked him, the Scarecrow wrung forty necks; at the end of the fight, all the birds lay dead\nat his feet. His companions got up and resumed their march. When the\nWicked Witch came to scan the horizon and discovered the piled-up corpses of\nher ravens, she flew into a terrible rage and blew her silver whistle three times. At once the air was filled with a powerful buzzing and a swarm of black bees came dancing above her head. - Catch these strangers,\nshe ordered, and kill them with your stings. The bees whirled and headed towards Dorothy and her friends. But the Woodcutter had seen them, and already the Scarecrow knew what to do. - Take my straw, he said, and\nspread it on the little one, the dog and the Lion; the bees won't be able to sting them.\nWhich the Woodcutter did; Dorothy, hugging Toto, nestled against the\nLion, and all three disappeared under the straw. When the bees arrived, only the Woodcutter was left; they sprang upon him, but broke their stingers against the tin, without causing him the least sting. And as these insects cannot survive the loss of their sting, so perished the black bees, and their remains were scattered about the Woodcutter like little heaps of small coal. Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the little girl helped the Tin Woodcutter to re-stuff the Scarecrow until he had recovered his good looks. Once more they set off again. The Wicked Witch, seeing her black bees\n40", "piled up like lumps of small coal, became mad with anger; she stamped her feet, tore her hair, and ground her teeth. She then called for a dozen slaves-the Ouinkiz-, gave them sharp spears, and ordered them to go and kill these foreigners. The Ouinkiz people were not the bravest, but\nthey had to obey; so they set off in pursuit of Dorothy. They had\nhardly caught up with her when the Lion leapt towards them, roaring so fiercely that the poor Ouinkiz, terrified, fled without asking for their rest.\nWhen they returned to the castle, the Witch gave them a good whipping\nwith a strap, then sent them back to their tasks; after which, she sat down to\nthink about what was best to do. She could not understand how\nall her plans had failed; nevertheless, she remained a very powerful Witch,\nas powerful as she was evil, and she soon found a new expedient.\nShe kept, in a cupboard, a golden Headdress, surrounded by a row of rubies and\ndiamonds. This Headdress was endowed with a charm. Whoever possessed it could\nsummon the help of the winged Monkeys three times: they had to accomplish\nall that was ordered of them. However, they could not be summoned more than three times.\nAnd twice already, the Wicked Witch had had recourse to the magical power of the\nHeaddress. First, when she had reduced the Ouinkiz to slavery, and established her dominion over their people. The Winged Monkeys had helped her in her enterprise. Then, when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and had driven him out of the\nWestern country. The Winged Monkeys had lent her their assistance. Once again, but the\nlast, could she have recourse to the charm of the Golden Cap. For this reason, she\nhad first tried all the other resources at her disposal. Now, now that her cruel wolves, her wild crows, her black bees had succumbed,\nthat her slaves had fled before the Cowardly Lion, this was the only means left to her to overcome Dorothy and her friends. The Witch then took the Golden Headdress out of her cupboard and placed it on her head. Then, standing on her left foot, she slowly said: - Ep-pe, pep-pe, pak-ke! Then, standing on her right foot, she said: - Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo! Finally, standing on her two feet, she shouted very loudly: - Ziz-zu, zuz-zy, zik! The spell began to work immediately. The sky darkened, while a dull rumble resounded in the air, soon followed by countless flapping wings and a cackle mixed with laughter. When the sun emerged from the darkened sky, the Witch could be seen surrounded by a multitude of monkeys, each equipped with a pair of immense and vigorous wings. The largest one seemed to lead the troop. With a beat of his wings, he came to rest near the Witch\nand said: - You have called us for the third and last time. What do you order? - Seize these foreigners who trample the balance of my country, and kill them all, except the Lion, said the Wicked Witch. Bring me this beast, I intend to harness it like a horse and make it work. - Your orders\nwill be carried out, said the chief. And in a tumult of shouts and chatter, the\n41", "Winged Monkeys flew away and soon after arrived at the place where Dorothy and her companions were walking. Two or three Monkeys seized the Tin Woodcutter and carried him through the air to a place covered with steep rocks. There they let him go, and the poor Woodcutter found his fall very long. He landed with a crash on the rocks, where he now lay, all bumpy and chipped, unable to move or even groan. Other Monkeys had seized the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers emptied him entirely of straw, including the head. From his hat, boots, and clothes, they made a bundle which they hung on the top of a large tree. Meanwhile, the other Monkeys tied up the Lion with\nthick ropes, winding rings around his body, his head, his\npaws, until he could no longer bite, nibble, or defend himself. Then they lifted him up and carried him to the Witch's castle, where he was locked in a courtyard\nsurrounded by a high iron gate, to prevent him from escaping. Dorothy, holding\nToto in her arms, looked at the sad fate inflicted on her friends, while thinking that\nit would soon be her turn. The leader of the winged Monkeys landed near her; he was already spreading\nhis long hairy arms, while his ugly face grimaced horribly; but the\nmark left on the girl's forehead froze him in place, and he forbade the others\nto touch her. - We must not harm this child, he told them, for she is\nprotected by the Powers of Good, which are stronger than the Powers of\nEvil. All we can do is to take her to the castle of the\nWicked Witch, and leave her there. They lifted Dorothy gently and\ncarefully, and carried her lightly to the castle, where they set her down\nat the foot of the steps. Then the chief spoke to the Witch: - We have obeyed you as much as we could. The Tin Man and the Scarecrow\nare destroyed, the Lion is captive in the yard. But we dare not touch the little\ngirl, nor her little dog. Your power over us has just ended, and you will\nnever see us again. Amidst a ruckus of laughter and chatter, the Winged Monkeys flew away and soon disappeared. At the sight of the sign imprinted on Dorothy\u2019s forehead, the Witch was at first surprised and upset; she knew well that, no more than the Winged Monkeys, she could not intend anything bad against her. She looked at Dorothy\u2019s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew that a powerful charm was attached to them. At once she was tempted to run away, but she changed her mind: Dorothy\u2019s eyes revealed to her all the innocence of her childish soul; it was evident that the little girl was unaware of the wonderful power she held thanks to the Silver Shoes. Chuckling to herself, the Witch said to herself: \"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know her power.\" Then, in a harsh and brutal tone, she ordered: - Follow me, and listen carefully to everything I tell you; otherwise, expect to suffer the fate of the Woodcutter and the Scarecrow. So Dorothea followed her into the castle, through a series of magnificent rooms; when they reached the kitchen,\n42", "The Witch ordered her to clean the pots and pans, to sweep the floor,\nand to keep the wood fire going. Dorothy set to work obediently, ready to work with all her heart and all her strength, too happy that the Wicked\nWitch had decided to spare her. Dorothy busy with her work, the Witch went\ntowards the enclosure of the Cowardly Lion; she intended to harness him like\na horse and hitch him to a cart: it would doubtless be very amusing to have him drag\nher along for the walk. But as soon as she had opened the gate, the Lion roared\nwith all his might and jumped so wildly that, frightened, she ran out and promptly closed the gate. - If I can't put a harness on you, she said\nthrough the bars, at least I can starve you. You won't have anything to eat until\nyou obey my good pleasure. From then on, the captive Lion was deprived of food;\nevery day at noon, the Witch appeared at the gate and asked: - Are you ready to\nwear the harness like a horse? And each time the Lion answered: - No! If\nyou enter this courtyard, I am sorry. If the Lion resisted the Witch's will so bravely, it was because every night, while she slept, Dorothy brought her food from the kitchen cupboard. When his meal was finished, he lay down on his straw litter, and the little girl lay down next to him, rested her head against his soft, bushy mane, and the two of them talked about their misfortunes and ruminated on plans to escape. But they found no way to escape from this castle, which was relentlessly watched by the yellow Ouinkiz; slaves of the Wicked Witch, they feared her too much to disobey her. The\nlittle girl had to work hard during the day; the Witch often threatened to\nbeat her, with the old umbrella that she never parted with. But in reality, she\ndid not dare to hit Dorothy, because of the sign she wore on her forehead. The child\ndidn't know anything about it, so she was always afraid for herself and Toto. Once, the\nWitch gave the little dog a blow with her umbrella; in return, the brave Toto rushed forward and bit its leg. However, the bite did not bleed: the blood had dried up in the veins of the wicked Witch\nlong ago. Dorothy's life grew sadder and sadder, as she lost hope of ever seeing Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would weep bitterly for hours, and Toto would lie at his little mistress's feet and look at her and moan, to show her that he shared her sorrow. Toto, in truth, cared little whether he was in Kansas or Oz, as long as Dorothy was with him; but he felt unhappy, which prevented him from being happy. Now the Wicked Witch was dying to have the Silver Shoes that the little girl wore. Her bees, her crows, her wolves lay in heaps and withered; she had exhausted all the power of the Golden Cap; If only she could get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than she had ever had. So she began to watch Dorothy, planning to steal her Shoes when she took them off. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes.", "that she only took them off at night or to take her bath. The Witch was far too\nafraid of the dark to venture into Dorothy's room at night;\nbut her fear of water was even greater, so she never went near\nDorothy was taking her bath. Indeed, the old Witch never touched the water, and\nnever let the water touch her. However, the evil creature had more than one\ntrick up her sleeve and finally found a trick that would allow her to seize the\nobject of her desire. She placed an iron bar across the kitchen floor and, by magic, made it invisible to human eyes. As\nDorothy crossed the kitchen, she tripped over the invisible bar and fell full\nlength to the floor. She did not hurt herself much, but in her fall she lost one of the\nSilver Shoes. Before she could even get it back, the Witch had seized it and put it on her bony foot. The wicked woman was jubilant at the\nsuccess of her trick; from the moment she possessed one of the shoes, she possessed half of their magic power, and Dorothy could not have used it against her, even if she had known their secret. Seeing that she had lost one of her\npretty shoes, the little girl became angry. \"Give me back my shoe,\" she said to the Witch. \"Never in my life,\" retorted the other, \"from now on, it belongs to me.\" \"You are a wicked creature,\" cried Dorothy. \"You have no right to take my shoe from me.\" - I don't care, I'll keep it, sneered the old woman, and\nI'll find an opportunity to take the other one from you. Dorothy could not help herself. Grabbing a tub that was there, she spilled its contents on the Witch, who was\nsoaked from head to foot. The ugly woman gave a scream of terror, and to the little girl's great surprise, began to shrink and get smaller. - You see what\nyou've done! she squeaked. In a moment, I'll have completely melted. - I'm\nreally sorry, said Dorothy, really frightened to see her melt like sugar before her eyes. - Didn't you know that water could be my downfall?\n\nasked the Witch in a plaintive and desperate voice. - Of course not, replied the child, how could I have guessed? - In a few minutes, I\nwill be completely dissolved, and my castle will be yours. I have been very malicious\nduring my life, but I never thought that a little girl like you would be able to melt me, and put an end to my misdeeds. Look: I am disappearing! At\nthese words, the Witch melted into a shapeless brownish mass, which spread\nover the clean kitchen floor. Seeing that she had melted for good,\nDoroth\u00e9e drew another bucket of water and poured it on this mess. Then, with great\nstrokes of her broom, she cleaned the room. Then, she picked up the Silver Slipper-all that\nwas left of the old woman-, washed it, dried it with a cloth and put it back on her foot. Finally free to do as she pleased, she ran to tell the Lion that they were freed forever from the Wicked Witch of the West, and that their captivity had just ended.\n44", "CHAPTER 13: DELIVERANCE\nThe Cowardly Lion was very happy to learn that the Wicked Witch had\nmelted thanks to a bucket of water; Dorothy immediately opened the gate of his prison and\nfreed him. Together, they entered the castle where Dorothy's first gesture\nwas to summon all the Ouinkiz, to announce the end of their slavery. The\nnews caused unparalleled rejoicing among the yellow Ouinkiz, for they\nhad had to toil for many years under the cruel yoke of the Wicked Witch.\nThis day of their deliverance would forever be a day of celebration, which they would\ncelebrate with banquets and dances. - If only our friends, the Scarecrow and the Woodcutter,\nwere with us, I would be perfectly happy, said the Lion. - Don't you think\nit is possible to help them? the little girl asked anxiously.\n\n\"We can always try,\" replied the Lion. They called the yellow Ouinkiz, and asked them if they would help them rescue their friends; the\nOuinkiz said they would be delighted to do anything in their power for\nthe one who had freed them from their servitude. Dorothy chose a few Ouinkiz among the\nmost knowledgeable, and they set out. They walked a whole day and part of the next day, before reaching the rocky plain where the poor\nWoodcutter lay, all battered and broken. His axe was near him, but the edge was rusty and the handle was short and broken. The Ouinkiz lifted him gently in their arms, and took him to the yellow castle, while, under the pained gaze of the Lion, Dorothy shed a few tears over the sad state of her old friend. When they reached the castle, the little girl asked the Ouinkiz: - Are there any tinsmiths among your people? - Of course! Some are even excellent workers, they replied. - Then go and get them for me, she said. Soon the tinsmiths arrived, carrying their boxes full of tools. Dorothy asked them - Are you able to straighten the dents on the Tin Man, reshape him and weld his notches? The tinsmiths examined the Woodcutter carefully and said they thought they could repair him and put him back in shape. They set to work at once, in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle, and worked for three days and four nights, hammering, twisting, bending, soldering, polishing, and hammering the legs, body, and head of the White Hellman. When they stopped, he had regained his old gait, and his joints worked as well as before. Of course, some joints had had to be soldered here and there, but the tinsmiths had done a good job, and as the Woodcutter was not vain, this mending left him indifferent. When, at last, he went into Dorothy\u2019s room to thank her for saving him, he felt so pleased.", "that he could not hold back tears of joy; Dorothy wiped them away one by one, carefully, with her handkerchief, for she must not let the joints rust again. At the same time, her own tears flowed abundantly, so much did the reunion with her old friend touch her, but these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail, that it soon got wet, and the Lion had to go out into the yard and hold it in the sun until it was dry. \"If only the Scarecrow were with us, I should be perfectly happy,\" said the Woodcutter, when Dorothy had told him her adventures. \"We must try to find him,\" said the little girl. She called the Ouinkiz to the rescue, and they walked together all that day and part of the\nnext day, before reaching the big tree at the top of which the Winged Monkeys\nhad thrown the Scarecrow's clothes. It was a very big tree, and\nits trunk was so smooth that we had to give up climbing it. But the Woodcutter said at once: - I will cut it down, and we can get the Scarecrow's clothes back. Now,\nwhile the tinsmiths were busy fixing the Woodcutter, another\nOuinkiz, who was a goldsmith, had made a solid handle, all of gold, and had\nfitted it to the Woodcutter's axe, in place of the old one. Others had cleaned\nthe edge of its rust and it shone like polished silver. As soon as he had spoken,\nthe Woodcutter began to cut the trunk, and soon after, the tree fell with a crack, and the Scarecrow's clothes fell from the branches and rolled on the ground.\nDorothy picked them up and they were taken back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice\nfresh straw; hold on tight! The Scarecrow was there, as handsome as before, and kept thanking each other for giving him life. Finally reunited, Dorothy and her friends had a great time in the yellow castle, safe from all\nneed. But one day, the little girl remembered Aunt Em, and she said: - We\nmust go back to Oz, and remind him of his promises. - Yes, said the Woodcutter,\nI shall have a heart at last. - And I, brains, added the Scarecrow, happily. -And I, courage, said the Lion thoughtfully. -And I, I will return to Kansas, cried Dorothy, clapping her hands. Oh! Let us leave tomorrow for the Emerald City!\n\nSo it was decided. The next day, they invited all the Weinkiz to bid them farewell. The Weinkiz were sorry to see them go. They had taken a special liking to the Woodcutter, whom they begged to stay with them to govern the yellow country of the West. But realizing that nothing would make them change their minds, they gave Toto and the Lion each a gold necklace; to Dorothy, a magnificent bracelet encrusted with diamonds; to the Scarecrow, a walking stick with a gold knob; As for the Woodcutter, he received a can of oil, in silver enhanced with gold and set with precious stones. In return, the travelers each in turn addressed a pretty speech of thanks to the Ouinkiz, and shook their hands until their arms fell from fatigue. Dorothy went to the cupboard to fill her basket with provisions for the road; it was then that she saw the Golden Headdress. She\n46", "tried it on: it looked wonderful. The little girl was unaware of the harm attached to the\nHeaddress, but she found it pretty and that was enough reason for her to put it on her head and put her little sunbonnet in the basket. Thus ready for the journey, they set off for the Emerald City. The Ouinkiz greeted their departure\nwith three cheers, and wished them all the best.\nCHAPTER 14: THE WINGED MONKEYS\nDo you remember that there was no road - not even a path - between\nthe castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City? When the four travelers had set out in search of the Witch, it was she who had seen them coming,\nand had sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. The return journey was therefore more difficult than the outward journey: they had to make their way through the great\nfields of buttercups and daisies. Of course, they knew that they had to go\nstraight east, towards the rising sun, and they took the right direction at first. But at noon, when the\nsun shone overhead, not knowing which was east and which was west, they got lost in the middle of the great\nfields. Nevertheless, they went on their way; at night the moon rose and shone in the sky. They then lay down\namong the sweet-peas, and slept soundly until morning -\nall except the Scarecrow and the Woodcutter. The next day the sun was hidden behind a cloud; yet they set off again as if they were sure of their way. - If we go far enough, said Dorothy, we shall get somewhere, I think. But the days went by, and they saw nothing before them but\nfields and fields of sweet peas. The Scarecrow began to grumble.\n- We have certainly lost our way, said he, and if we do not find it in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\n- Nor me, my dear, added the Woodcutter. I am boiling with impatience to get to Oz, and you must admit that this journey never ends.\n- You see, whined the Cowardly Lion, I have not the courage to wander blindly, without ever arriving anywhere. Then Dorothy felt her courage abandon her. She sat down in the grass and looked at her companions. They sat down and looked at her; and for the first time in his life, Toto felt too tired to chase the butterfly that was flying\nabove his head; he was panting, his tongue hanging out, and looked at Dorothy, as\nif to ask her what we were going to do. \"Shall we call the field mice?\" she suggested. \"They would certainly show us the way to the Emerald City.\" \"Of course!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"How did we not think of it sooner?\" Dorothy grabbed the little whistle she had been carrying around her elbow since the Queen\n47", "mice had given it to her, and whistled. Soon a trotting of little paws was heard: hundreds of gray mice were running. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked in her flute-like voice: - What can I do for my friends? - We have lost our way, said Dorothy. Can you tell us where the Emerald City is? - Certainly, replied the Queen,\nbut it is very far from here, for you have always turned your back on it. It was then that she noticed Dorothy's Golden Headdress. - Why don't you use the Headdress's magic spell? You could call the Winged Monkeys, they would transport you to the City of Oz in less than an hour. - A magic spell? Dorothy wondered. I didn't know the Headdress had one. What is it? - It is written inside, replied the Queen. But if you decide to call the\nWinged Monkeys, we had better flee before they come, because they are full of\nmischief and love to torment us. - But they will perhaps hurt me? the little girl worried. - Oh! no! They must obey the one who wears the Headdress.\nGoodbye! And the Queen quickly ran off, followed by all the mice. Dorothy looked inside the Headdress and saw some words written on the lining. \"Here is the formula,\" she said to herself, and she read the instructions carefully, then put the Headdress on her head. - Ep-pe, pep-pe, pak-ke! she said, raising her right foot. - What are you saying? asked the Scarecrow, not understanding. - Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\n\nDorothy continued, lifting her left foot. - Hello! answered the Woodcutter placidly. - Ziz-zu, zuz-zy, zik! said Dorothy, standing on her two feet. The magic words had barely finished when they heard chattering mixed with the clapping of wings: the troop of winged Monkeys was flying towards them. The King bowed before the little girl: - What do you want? he asked. - We would like to go to the Emerald City, said the child; we have lost our way. - We will take you there, answered the King. At once two Monkeys took Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others seized the Scarecrow, the Woodcutter, and the Lion, while a little Monkey followed them, holding Toto in his arms, in spite of the dog\u2019s efforts to bite him. The Scarecrow and the Woodcutter were not very reassured. They remembered how unkindly the Winged Monkeys had treated them in the past. But when they understood that no one meant them any harm, they abandoned themselves to their guides and amused themselves by looking at the pretty fields and woods that passed by, far below them. Dorothy found the journey pleasant, sitting comfortably between two of the larger Monkeys, one of whom was the King himself. They had\nformed a chair with their joined hands, and were careful not to shake\nthe little girl too much. - Why did you obey the magic formula of the Headdress?\nshe asked. - It is a long story, replied the King, laughing; but since\nwe have time before us, I can tell it to you during the journey, if you wish. - That would please me, replied the child. - Once, began\nthe King, we were a free people and lived happily in the great forest, flying\n48", "from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruits, obeying only our pleasure,\nwithout having to serve a master. Some of us were perhaps too full of\nmischief, sometimes: they pulled wingless animals by the tail, chased\nbirds, pelted the heads of forest walkers with nuts... But we\nlived carefree, happy, loving to laugh and enjoying every hour of the day.\nThis happened a very long time ago, long before Oz came down from the clouds\nto rule this land. \"At that time, there lived, in the northern region, a\nbeautiful princess who was also a very powerful magician. All her power\nwas used to help people, and she was never seen to harm anyone good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a sumptuous palace, built from large blocks\nof rubies. Everybody loved her, but great was her sadness at finding no one\nto love in return, for all men were either too stupid or too ugly to\ndeserve the hand of such a beautiful and wise person. However, she finally discovered a boy, handsome, virile, and of a wisdom beyond his years. Gayelette decided\nto wait until he was quite a man to marry him; she brought him to her ruby \u200b\u200bpalace, and used all her magic powers to make him as strong, good, and\nlovable as a woman could wish. Having reached the age of reason, Kelala (that was his\nname), enjoyed the reputation of the best and most intelligent man in the whole country; and his masculine beauty was such that Gayelette, cherishing him more and\nmore tenderly, hastened the preparations for the marriage. \"My grandfather was then the\nKing of the Winged Monkeys, and lived in the forest near the palace of Gayelette. He was a\nmerry joker, who would rather have missed a good meal than a good joke. One day,\njust before the wedding, my grandfather who was flying with his troop, saw Kelala walking along the river, dressed in a rich costume of pink silk\nand purple velvet. My grandfather wanted to put him to the test. At his command, the Monkeys went to pick Kelala, carried him over the river, and from\nup there, dropped him at dawn in the middle of the waves. \"- Swim, swim, my friend,\nmy grandfather shouted to him, and look carefully if the water has not stained your clothes. \"Ke-\nlala was much too wise not to know how to swim, and his good fortune had\nin no way spoiled his character. He emerged from the water and swam laughing towards the bank.\nBut Gayelette ran; she saw the beautiful silk and velvet costume all damaged\nby the mishap. \"The princess was very angry, and of course, knew the\nculprit. She had all the winged Monkeys appear before her, and ordered that\ntheir wings be tied: they would be treated as they had treated Kelala, and thrown\ninto the river. My grandfather pleaded his cause, in despair, knowing\ntoo well that with their wings tied, the Monkeys would drown in the river. Kelala himself intervened in their favor, so that Gayelette finally spared them, but on one condition: henceforth, the Winged Monkeys would have to obey three times the orders given to them by the owner of the Golden Headdress. This Headdress had been made expressly as a wedding present for Kelala, and it was claimed that the Winged Monkeys would be killed by the owner of the Golden Headdress.", "said that it had cost the princess half her kingdom. Naturally,\nmy grandfather and his companions immediately accepted the famous condition; that is how we have become the servants of whoever possesses the\nGolden Headdress, and must submit three times to his orders.\" - And what happened next? asked Dorothy, who was greatly interested in this story. - Kelala being\nthe first owner of the Headdress, he was the first to impose his will on us.\nAs his young fianc\u00e9e could not bear the sight of us, after her marriage, he\ngathered us together in the forest and ordered us to always keep out of the princess's way; and we obeyed happily, for she frightened us. \u201cThat was\nthe only order we had to carry out until the Golden Crown fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West. She forced us to enslave the\nWinkiz, and then to drive Oz himself out of the West. Now the Crown\nis yours, and you have the right to make three wishes.\u201d As the Monkey King\nfinished his story, Dorothy looked down and saw the green, glittering\nwalls of the Emerald City. Although she marveled at the swift flight of the Monkeys,\nshe was nevertheless glad that the journey was over. The strange creatures\ngently set the travelers down at the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy and flew away lightly, followed by his winged troop. - We had a good trip, said the little girl. - Yes, agreed the Lion,\nit quickly got us out of trouble. How lucky you were to have brought\nthis marvelous Headdress!\nCHAPTER 15: THE MEETING WITH OZ THE\nFEARFUL\nThe four travelers advanced towards the great gate of the Emerald City,\nand rang. After ringing several times, it was opened for them by the same\nGuardian of the Gates whom they had met previously. - What! you are\nback? he asked, astonished. - You don't see us? said the Scarecrow ironically. - But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of\nthe West? - We visited her, indeed, replied the Scarecrow. - And she\nlet you go? said the man, more and more astonished. - She could not help it, she melted, explained the Scarecrow. - Melted! That is good news! And who melted her? - It was Dorothy, said the Lion, gravely. - Goodness! exclaimed the Doorkeeper, and he bowed very low to the little girl. Then he led them into his little room, and fastened on each of them the spectacles taken from his big box, just as he had done some time before. After which, they crossed the 50", "portal and entered the City. When the people learned from the Guardian of the Gates that they had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, a crowd surrounded the travelers and followed them in a large procession to the Palace of Oz. The soldier with the green whiskers was still guarding the entrance, but he let them pass immediately. They saw the beautiful green servant again, who led each of them to their old room to take a little rest, while waiting for Oz to receive them. The soldier had immediately informed the Wizard of the return of Dorothy and her companions, as well as of the death of the Wicked Witch. Oz had answered with silence. The travelers expected him to summon them immediately, but he did nothing. Neither the\nnext day, nor the\nnext day, nor the day after that, did they receive any message.\nThe waiting grew weary and painful, and they ended by being offended that Oz should treat them so badly,\nafter having made them endure so much trouble and servitude. At last the Scarecrow asked the\ngreen maid to convey to Oz that if he did not grant them an interview at once,\nthey would call the Winged Monkeys to the rescue, and it would be seen whether he\ncould keep his promises or not. When the Wizard received the message, so great was his\nfright that he fixed the meeting for the next morning, at four minutes past nine,\nin the Throne Room. He had had dealings with the Winged Monkeys once, in the\nWest Country, and did not wish to see them again. The four travelers could not sleep all night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to grant her. Dorothy dozed off once and dreamed that she was in Kansas, and while Em\ntold her how happy she was to have found her little girl. The next morning, at nine o\u2019clock, the soldier with the green whiskers hastened to call them together; four minutes later, they all entered the Throne Room of Oz the Great. Naturally, each of them expected to see the Wizard again in the form he had assumed when they first met him; so they were much surprised to see a living soul in the room. They stood close to the door, pressing close together, for the silence of that deserted room was even more terrifying than any of the appearances Oz had assumed the first time. Presently they heard a voice\nthat seemed to come from the great dome, somewhere above, and that said solemnly: - I am Oz, the Great and the Dreadful. Why do you want to see me? They\nlooked around every corner of the room, but seeing no one, Dorothy asked: - Where are you? - I am everywhere, answered the voice, but to the\neyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now sit on my\nThrone, that we may converse. Indeed, the voice now seemed to come\nstraight from the Throne; so they came towards her and stood in a line,\nwhile Dorothy began: - We have come to remind you of your promises, oh Great Oz. - What promises? asked Oz. - You promised to bring me back to Kansas, as soon as the Witch was destroyed, said the little girl. - And you\npromised to give me a brain, said the Scarecrow. - And you promised\n51", "to give me a heart, added the Tin Woodcutter. - And you promised to give me courage, added the Cowardly Lion. - Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed? asked the voice. And Dorothy thought she heard that she was trembling slightly. - Yes, she answered. I melted it with a bucket of water. -\nMy God, said the voice, how sudden! Very well, come back to see me tomorrow,\nI must think about all this. - You have had plenty of time to think, said the Tin Woodcutter. - We will not wait another day, growled the Scarecrow. - You\nmust keep the promises you made to us, exclaimed Dorothy. The Cowardly Lion\nthought he should intervene too and frighten the Magician; so he let out a terrible roar, so ferocious that Toto, alarmed, jumped aside and fell against a\nscreen set up in a corner, which collapsed. The crash of his fall drew their eyes in that direction, and what they saw filled them all with stupor. At the very spot that the screen had hidden from them, stood a little old man, bald and wrinkled,\nand who seemed just as surprised as the travelers. The Woodcutter, raising his axe,\nrushed toward the little man, shouting: - Who are you? - I am Oz, the Great and the\nDreadful, said the little man in a trembling voice, but I\npray you, do not strike me, I will do anything you wish. Our friends looked at him in amazement\nand consternation. - I thought Oz was a great Head, said Dorothy. - And I,\na beautiful Lady, said the Scarecrow. - And I, a terrible Wild Beast, said the Woodcutter. - And I, a Ball of Fire, said the Lion. - No! you were mistaken, admitted\nthe little man humbly. I only made you believe it. - Make you believe it! repeated\nDorothy. You are not a Great Wizard, then? - Hush! my child, said he, do not\nspeak so loudly; if you were heard, it would be my loss. Everyone thinks\nI am a Great Wizard. - And you are not one? she asked. - Not in the least, dear little one. I am only an ordinary man. - Oh! you are more than\nthat! said the Scarecrow, in a tone of bitter reproach. You are a charlatan. - Very\nexactly! declared the little man, rubbing his hands, as if delighted\nby the etiquette. I am a charlatan. - But it is a catastrophe! said the Woodcutter. I\nshall never have a heart, then? - No courage? asked the Lion. - No brains? moaned the Scarecrow, drying his tears with the back of his overcoat. - My\ndear friends, said Oz, I pray you, let us forget these trifles. Think rather of me, and of\nthe embarrassment in which your discovery places me. - Does any one else know that you are\na charlatan? Dorothy asked. - No one, except you four - and myself,\nOz answered. I fooled everyone for so long that I thought\nI would never be found out. I made a big mistake letting you enter\nthe Throne Room. I usually don't show myself to my subjects, that's\nhow they are convinced that I am a terrible being. - But I don't understand,\nDorothy said, helpless. How did you manage to appear to me in the form\nof a great Head? - It was one of my tricks, Oz answered. Come here,\nplease, I'll explain everything to you. Behind the throne was a small room where\n52", "he made them come in. On the floor, in a corner, he showed them the great Head, made of several thicknesses of paper, and the face carefully painted. - I hung it from the ceiling by a thread, said Oz. I stood hidden behind the screen, and thanks to another thread, I made the eyes move and the mouth open. - But the voice? insisted Dorothy, intrigued. - I am a ventriloquist, said the little man, and I can direct the sound of my voice where I want it; that is why you thought it came from this Head. These are the other tricks I used to fool you. He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask by which he had passed himself off as the beautiful Lady; and the Woodcutter could see that his Wild Beast was only a collection\nof sewn skins, mounted on whalebones to hold the sides apart. As for\nthe Fireball, the false magician also hung it from the ceiling. It was in reality\na ball of cotton; but once soaked in oil, it burned furiously. -\nAll the same, said the Scarecrow, you should be ashamed, to be such a charlatan. - But I am ashamed, very ashamed, replied the little man, sadly. Alas!\nI had no choice. Sit down, I pray you, there are plenty of seats; I\nwill tell you my story. So they sat down, and this is what he told them:\n- I was born in Omaha... - But it is not so far from Kansas! interrupted\nDorothy. - No; but it is not near here, he said, shaking his head sadly. When I was grown up, I learned the trade of ventriloquist, under the direction of a great master. I can imitate any bird or animal. At this, he meowed like a little cat, so like one that Toto, pricking up his ears, began to ferret around in the corners. - After a while, he continued, I got tired of it, and made myself a balloon man. - What is it? asked Dorothy. -\nA man who advertises for a circus, he explained. On the days of the show, he goes up in a balloon to attract the crowd of curious people, and to get them to attend the paying show. - Oh! I see! she said. - So, one day when I got into the balloon, the ropes got twisted so that I could not come down.\nThe balloon rose above the clouds, a strong current of air caught it and carried it away\nleagues and leagues beyond. I wandered in the sky all day and night. On the morning\nof the second day, I woke up and found that I was floating above a strangely beautiful land. \"The balloon descended gradually to the ground, and landed\nwithout a hitch. I found myself among a strange people, who, seeing me disembark from the clouds, took me for a Great Magician. Naturally, I let them believe it, for it inspired them with fear and respect, and they promised to do whatever I wanted. \"To amuse myself and give work to these good people, I ordered them to build this City and my Palace, which they carried out with good heart and talent. As this country was of a magnificent green, I decided to call it the Emerald City, and to make it more real, I decreed that everyone would wear green glasses, so that everything they saw would be green.\" - So everything is not green here? asked Dorothy. - No more than anywhere else, replied Oz. But\n53", "of course, with green glasses, everything seems so. - The Emerald City was\nbuilt a long time ago, for I was a very young man when the\nball brought me; I am an old man now. But my people have worn\nthese green glasses so long that most of them believe it is really\nan Emerald City; in any case, it is a very beautiful country, where precious stones and\nmetals abound, and all things indispensable to the happiness of the people. I have\nbeen good to my people, and they love me; but since its construction, I have\nlocked myself in my Palace, and no one has ever seen me again. \"What I feared most were the Witches, for I had no magical powers, although they were truly capable of performing wonders. There were four of them who divided the country between them, and each ruled over the people who lived in the North, South, East, and West. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew that I had nothing to fear from them; but those of the East and West were terribly evil, and if they had not believed me to be more powerful than they were, they would not have hesitated to destroy me. Thus I lived for years in fear and anguish; you can imagine my joy when I heard\nthat your house had, falling, crushed the Wicked Witch of the East. When\nyou came to me, I was ready to promise you anything, provided\nyou got rid of the other Witch; now that you have melted her,\nI confess, to my great shame, that I am incapable of keeping my promises.\" \"You\nare only a wicked man!\" Dorothy said indignantly. \"Oh! no, my dear child; I am a\nvery good man, but a very bad magician, I must admit.\" \"In\nthat case, you can't give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"You\ndon't need them. Every day teaches you something new. A\nbaby has a brain, but it doesn't know much. Only experience teaches, and the longer you live on this earth, the more experience you will acquire. \"That is\n\npossible,\" protested the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very unhappy until I\nhave brains.\" The false magician looked at him with a look. \"Well,\" he said, sighing. \"I have hardly the gifts of a magician, I told you; but if you insist,\ncome tomorrow morning, and I will fill your head with a brain. However, I\ncannot give you the instructions for using it; you must discover them for yourself.\" \"Oh!\nthank you! thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I will find a way to use it, have\nno fear.\" \"And... what about my courage?\" asked the Lion anxiously. \"I am sure you are full of it,\" replied Oz. What you lack is\nconfidence in yourself. Anything that is fearful in the face of danger. True courage\nconsists therefore in braving the danger that is fearful, and this kind of courage is\nnot lacking in you. - Perhaps, said the Lion, but that does not reassure me one bit. I will be\nreally very unhappy, until you have given me this kind of courage that makes one forget that one is afraid. - Very well, said Oz, tomorrow, I will help you.\n- And... what about my heart? asked the Tin Woodcutter. - Then,\n54", "there, said Oz, I think you are wrong to want a heart. Most people are very unhappy with them. If you only knew what they are, you would be glad to be without them. \"It must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Woodcutter. \"As for me, if you give me a heart, I will bear the misfortune without a murmur.\" \"Very well,\" said Oz, resigned. \"I have played the magician for years, why not make the part last a little longer?\" \"And as for me,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\" \"We will consider the matter,\" replied the little man. \"Give me two or three days to think about it, and I will try to find some way to get you across the desert.\" In the meantime, you will be treated as my guests, and\nduring your stay at the Palace my people will serve you and obey your\nleast desires. On the other hand, given the situation, I ask only one thing of you,\nfor my own safety: keep my secret. Do not reveal to anyone that I am a\ncharlatan. They agreed not to say anything of what they had just learned, and returned to their rooms, comforted and joyful. Even Dorothy kept the hope\nthat the \"Great and Dreadful Charlatan\", as she had nicknamed him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas; and in that case, she felt ready to\nforgive him everything.\nCHAPTER 16: THE MAGIC ART OF THE GREAT\nCHARLATAN\nThe next morning, the Scarecrow said to his friends: - You can congratulate me.\nI am going to Oz's soon, I will finally have my brains. When I come back, I will be a man like the others. - I have always loved you as\nyou were, said Dorothy, naively. - You are very kind, to love a simple\nScarecrow. But you will see, you will esteem me even more, when you\nhear the astonishing thoughts that will spring from my brain. He greeted them all\njoyfully, and went to the Throne Room, where he knocked at the door. - Come in, said Oz. The Scarecrow came in and found the little man sitting by the window, deep in thought. \"I have come to get my brains,\" said the Scarecrow, \"a little uncomfortable.\" \"Oh, that's right; sit on that chair, if you please,\" said Oz. \"You must excuse me, but I must take your head off. I have to do it, to put your brains in their proper place.\" \"All right,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I thank you for taking my head off, since I'll put a better one on afterward.\" The Wizard took off his head and emptied the straw. He went into the next room, took a measure of bran, and mixed it with a good deal of pins and needles. He\nshakes everything, to obtain a perfect mixture, then fills the bottom of the head, and\n55", "stuffing the rest with straw, in order to keep the brains well wedged. Then, he\nattached the Scarecrow\u2019s head to his body, saying to him: -From now on, you are\na great man, because I have given you a first-rate brain. As well as being happy, since his dearest wish had just been fulfilled, the Scarecrow thanked Oz very warmly and returned to his friends. Dorothy looked at him curiously. The bumps of his brain protruded at the top of his forehead. - How do you feel? she asked. - To tell the truth, I feel\nintelligent, he answered gravely. When I get used to this brain, I will be omniscient. - What are these pins and needles that\ncome out of your skull? asked the Woodcutter. - It is to prove that his mind\nhas some sting, commented the Lion. - Good! My turn to introduce myself to Oz, said\nthe Woodcutter. He went to the Throne Room and knocked on the door. - Come in! said Oz, and\nthe Woodcutter entered. - I come for my heart, he said. - Very well, replied the little\nman. But I will have to cut a hole in your chest, to put\nthe heart in its place. I hope that will not make you suffer. - But no, said the\nWoodcutter, I will not feel anything at all. Oz therefore took a pair of metal scissors,\ncut a small square on the left side of the Woodcutter's chest. Then, from a chest of drawers, he took out a small heart made entirely of silk and filled it with sawdust. - It is beautiful, isn't it? he remarked. - And how! approved the Woodcutter, completely delighted. But... is it a generous heart? - Excellent! replied Oz. He installed the heart in the Woodcutter's chest, readjusted the square of tin and welded it. - There! he said, you now have a heart that any man would be proud to possess. I am sorry to have had to tear your chest, but there was no way to avoid it. - Too bad for the tear, exclaimed the happy Woodcutter. I am infinitely grateful to you, and will never forget your kindness. - Let us not speak of it any more, prayed Oz. The Tin Woodman returned to his friends, who\nwished him happiness and joy. The Lion in turn went to the Throne Room,\nand knocked on the door. - Come in! said Oz. - I have come to seek my courage, announced the\nLion as he entered. - Perfect, replied the little man. I have what you need. He opened\na cupboard, and seized, from a high shelf, a green, square jar, the contents of which he poured\ninto a richly carved green gold cup. He placed it under the nose of the\nCowardly Lion, who sniffed it with a disgusted air, and said to him: - Drink! - What\nis it? asked the Lion. - Well, said Oz, if it were in you, it would be courage. You know that courage is always inside people; it cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. That is why I advise you to drink it as quickly as possible. Without further hesitation, the Lion drained the cup to the last drop. - So, how do you feel? asked Oz. - I am full of courage, answered the Lion, who happily went to tell his friends his good fortune. When Oz was alone again, he smiled as he thought of how he had managed to give the Scarecrow, the Woodcutter, and the Lion exactly 56", "what they thought they lacked. \"How can I not act like a charlatan?\" he said to himself, \"when all these people ask me to do things that\neveryone knows are impossible. It was easy to please the Scarecrow, the Lion,\nand the Woodcutter, because they imagined that I was all-powerful. But to bring\nDorothea back to Kansas, I'll need more imagination, and I know\nwell that I don't know how to go about it!\"\nCHAPTER 17: HOW THE BALL WAS LAUNCHED\nFor three days, Dorothy had no news from Oz. These days passed sadly for the little girl, in spite of the joy and contentment of her friends. The Scarecrow said that wonderful thoughts came to his mind, but that he\nwould not tell them, for he alone could understand them. When the Woodcutter walked, he felt his heart move like a rattle in his chest;\nand he confided to Dorothy that he found him better and more tender than when he\nwas a man of flesh. The Lion declared that he was no longer afraid of anything. \"Bring him an army of men or a dozen fierce Kalidahs, he would be glad to face them.\" So all the little company were satisfied,\nexcept Dorothy, who yearned more than ever for her dear Kansas. On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne\nRoom, he said cheerfully: \"Sit down, my child. I think I have found a way to get you out of this country.\" \"And to bring me to Kansas?\" she asked impatiently. \"True, I am not sure that it is in Kansas, for I do not know which side it is on,\" admitted Oz. \"But the first thing to do is to cross this desert; then it should be easy to find your way home.\" \"And how to cross the desert?\" \"I will tell you my plan,\" said the little man. \"You see, I came to this country in a balloon. You also came by air, carried by a cyclone. So I think the best way to cross the desert is to fly over it.\" Of course, I can\u2019t\nmake a cyclone; but on second thought, I think I can\nmake a balloon. - How? asked Dorothy. - A balloon, explained Oz, is made\nof a silk fabric, which is coated with strong glue, so that it keeps the gas\ninside. I have large reserves of silk at the Palace, it won\u2019t be difficult\nto make the balloon. But in this country, they can\u2019t find the gas needed to\ninflate the balloon and make it float. - If it doesn\u2019t float, it won\u2019t be of any use to us! - Very true, replied Oz. But there is another way of making it float, which\nconsists of filling it with hot air. It\u2019s not as good as gas, because if it cools, the ball-\n57", "we would land in the desert, and we would be lost. - We! exclaimed the little girl.\n\nSo you are coming with me? - Indeed, said Oz, I am tired of living as a charlatan. If I\nwere to leave my Palace, my people would soon discover that I am not a\nMagician, and would be angry with me for having deceived them. As for remaining cloistered in these rooms,\nit is boring in the long run. I had better return to Kansas with you, and\nengage myself in a circus again. - I shall be delighted with your company.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he replied. Now, will you help me sew the silk, we will\nset at once to our balloon.\" So Dorothy took a needle and thread; as Oz cut strips of silk into the desired shape, the little girl\ncarefully sewed them together. First came a light green stripe, then a dark green stripe, then another emerald green; for Oz had taken a fancy to make a balloon of all the shades of green that surrounded them. The work took them three days, but when it was finished, they had a large bag of green silk, more than twenty feet long. Then Oz coated the inside with a layer of strong glue to make it airtight: the balloon was finished. - We also need a large basket, to travel in, said Oz. And he sent the soldier with the green favorites to fetch a large wicker trunk, which he tied with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon. When everything was ready, Oz sent word to his people that they were going to visit a brother Magician who lived in the clouds. The news spread quickly through the City, and everyone came to witness this prodigy. Oz ordered the balloon to be placed in front of the Palace, and the people examined it with great curiosity. The Tin Woodman had cut a large pile of wood; he was now making a pyre of it, while Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire, to allow the hot air that came out of it to fill the silk bag. Little by little, the balloon swelled and rose into the air, the basket already just touching the ground. Then Oz jumped into the trunk and addressed his people in a loud voice: - I am going on a visit. During my absence, the Scarecrow will rule over you. I ask you to obey him as I would myself. However, the balloon pulled hard on the rope that held it to the ground; filled with hot air, it was lighter than the surrounding atmosphere, and it was irresistibly trying to rise up into the sky. - Come, Dorothy!\n\nshouted the Magician. Hurry up, the balloon is going to fly away. - I can't find Toto, replied Dorothy, who did not want to abandon her little dog. Toto\nhad escaped into the crowd, chasing a little cat, but Dorothy finally caught up with him. She grabbed him and ran towards the balloon. She was only three steps away, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her jump into the basket, when, crack!\n\nthe rope gave way! and the balloon rose into the sky, without Dorothy. - Come back! she shouted, I want to go with you! - Impossible, dear child, Oz shouted from the top of his\nbasket. Goodbye! - Goodbye! cried the crowd. And all eyes followed the ascent of the Wizard in the basket, which rose into the sky, ever, ever higher. This was\nthe last time that Oz, the wonderful Wizard, was seen, although he must have reached\n58", "safe and sound in Omaha, where he now lives, for all we know. But the\npeople continued to cherish his memory, and said to one another: - Oz\nwas always our friend. When he lived among us, he built for us\nthis beautiful Emerald City, and when he departed, he left the wise Scarecrow\nto govern us. For a long time they regretted the loss of the wonderful\nMagician, and refused to be comforted by it.\nCHAPTER 18: ON THE ROAD SOUTH\nDorothy wept bitterly: the hope of seeing her dear Kansas again had vanished;\nbut after turning the matter over in her mind, she was very glad\nshe had not gone up in a balloon. Indeed, she grieved over Oz's departure as much as her companions. The Tin Woodman came to her and said: - I would be ungrateful\nif I did not weep for the man who gave me such a tender heart. I would like to shed\na few tears on my departure from Oz; would you be so kind as to dry me, so that\nI may not rust? - With pleasure, she answered; and she brought a towel. For some minutes the Woodman wept, while she watched for his tears and\ncarefully blotted them as they fell. When he had finished crying, he thanked her and\nrubbed himself with the oil from his silver can, to keep himself from\nany mishap. The Scarecrow now ruled the Emerald City, and although he\nwas not a Wizard, his people were very proud of him. \"For,\" said the people, \"this is the only City in the world that is governed by a man of straw.\" And until proven otherwise, they were not wrong. The day after the balloon had flown away with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room to discuss this and that. The Scarecrow was enthroned, and the others stood respectfully before him. \"We have no reason to complain,\" said the new master; \"this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we are free to do as we please. When I think that not so long ago I was perched on a stake in a farmer's wheat field, and that now I am at the head of this splendid City, I can only thank my destiny.\" \"I, too,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"am very pleased with my new heart; indeed,\nit was the only desire of my life.\" \"As for me, I am glad to know that I am as\nbrave as any other beast in the world, if not braver,\" said the Lion,\nmodestly. \"If only Dorothy would live in the Emerald City,\" continued the Scarecrow, \"we could all be happy together.\" \"But I\ndon't want to live here,\" cried Dorothy. \"I want to go back to Kansas, and live with\nAunt Em and Uncle Henry.\" \"Then what can we do?\" asked the Tin Woodman.", "cheron. The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the needles and pins\nbristled on his head. At last he said: - Why don't you call the Winged Monkeys? They could make you fly over the desert. - I didn't think of that, said the little girl happily. That's just what I need! I'm running to get the Golden Cap.\nSoon after, she was back with the enchanted Cap; no sooner had she uttered the magic\nformula than the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window\nand came to rest in front of her. - This is the second time you have called us,\nsaid the Monkey King to the child, bowing before her. What do you want? - I\nwant you to take me to Kansas, said Dorothy. But the Monkey shook his\nhead. \"That is impossible,\" he said. \"We belong to this country, we have no\nright to cross its borders. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas\nbefore, and I think there never will be, for we are not part of that\ncountry. We would like to please you, but we are forbidden to cross the\ndesert. Good-bye!\" He bowed a second time, spread his wings, and flew away with his\nband out the window. Dorothy would have wept with disappointment. \"The Winged Monkeys\ncannot help me. I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap for nothing,\" she said.\n\"That is a pity!\" sighed the tender-hearted Woodcutter. The Scarecrow had begun to think again, and his head was bulging so dangerously that Dorothy thought it would burst. \u201cLet us call the soldier with the green whiskers,\u201d he said, \u201cand ask his advice.\u201d The soldier was sent for, and he entered the Throne Room timidly, for in Oz\u2019s time he had never been allowed to cross its threshold. \u201cThis child,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cwants to cross the desert. How is she to go about it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the soldier; \u201cso far no one, except Oz himself, has ever succeeded.\u201d \u201cAnd no one can help me?\u201d asked the little girl anxiously. \u201cGlinda, perhaps,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWho is Glinda?\u201d asked the Scarecrow. - She is the Witch of the South, the most powerful of all Witches.\nShe rules over the Kouadlingz. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so it is possible that she knows a way to cross it. - She is a\nGood Witch, is she not? - The Kouadlingz think so, said the soldier, and she is\nkind to all. I have heard that Glinda is a very beautiful woman,\nwho knows how to stay young despite her years, because she has lived a very long time. - How\ndo we get to her castle? asked Dorothy. - We must go straight\ntowards the South, he explained, but they say that a thousand dangers await those\nwho venture into these parts. There are ferocious beasts in the forests, and\nabove all a people of strange men, who hate it when we cross their country. That is\nwhy no Kouadling has ever come to the Emerald City. The soldier withdrew\nand the Scarecrow spoke: - Despite the dangers, the best thing is for Dorothy to go\nto the South country, and implore Glinda's help. For it is obvious, if Dorothy stays here, she will never return to Kansas. - You must have thought again,\nremarked the Woodcutter. - That is true, said the Scarecrow. - I am accompanying Dorothy,\n60", "said the Lion, for I am weary of your City, and long for the great woods and the country. I am a real wild beast, you see. Besides, Dorothy needs someone to protect her. \"You are right,\" agreed the Woodcutter. \"My axe\nmay be useful to her too; so I will go, too, to the South Country.\" \"When are we leaving?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"Are you coming too?\" they wondered. \"Of course! Without Dorothy, I would never have had a brain. It was she who took me off my stake in the cornfield, and brought me to the Emerald City.\" It is to\nher that I owe my good fortune, and I will not leave her until she has\nreturned to Kansas for good. \u201cThank you,\u201d said Dorothy gratefully. \u201cYou are\nall so kind to me. But I would like to leave as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cWe are leaving tomorrow,\u201d decided the Scarecrow. \u201cLet us go and make our preparations, for the journey will be\nlong.\u201d\nCHAPTER 19: THE ATTACK OF THE FIGHTING\nTREES\nThe next morning, Dorothy kissed the green maid goodbye, and\nthey all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had accompanied them to the main gate. The Guardian was very surprised to see them leave the Emerald City once more to meet new troubles. But he turned the lock on their glasses, which he put away in the green box, and wished them good luck. \u201cNow you are the ones who govern us,\u201d he said to the Scarecrow; \u201cyou must come back as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cThat is my intention,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut first I must help Dorothy to return home.\u201d Dorothy bade the brave Guardian a last farewell: \u201cI have been well treated in your kind City, and everyone has been kind to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for it.\u201d \u201cNo need, my dear child,\u201d replied the Guardian. \u201cWe would like to keep you with us, but since you wish to return to Kansas, I wish you success.\u201d Then he opened the gate of the rampart, and the travelers set out. The sun shone brightly, while our friends directed their steps toward the southern land. Full of enthusiasm, they laughed and talked together. Once more, Dorothy regained hope; the Woodcutter and the Scarecrow were delighted to be useful to her; as for the Lion, he breathed the fresh air with delight, and flapped his tail with the sheer pleasure of being in the country. Toto, for his part, was wriggling around them, and chasing a thousand insects and butterflies without ceasing to bark. \"City life doesn't suit me at all,\" remarked the Lion, as they trotted along briskly. \"I've lost a lot of weight over there; besides, I'm anxious to show the other animals how\n61", "I have become brave. They came to a bend in the road and looked one\nlast time at the Emerald City. A forest of steeples and towers stood behind the green ramparts, dominated by the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz. \u201cAll things considered, Oz was not such a bad Wizard,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, listening to his heart rattle in his chest. \u201cHe did give me brains, and not just any brains,\u201d added the Scarecrow. \u201cIf Oz had taken any of the courage he gave me,\u201d said the Lion, \u201che would have been a very brave man.\u201d Dorothy was not. Oz had not kept his promises to her. But he had tried his best, so she forgave him. As he himself had said, he was a bad Wizard, but a good man nonetheless. The first\nday of walking, the road wound through the green and flowery meadows that surrounded the\nEmerald City. They slept in the grass, under the stars, and their rest was no less pleasant. The\nnext morning, their path led them to a dense forest. There was no path to go around it, for it seemed to stretch\non either side to the horizon; moreover, they did not dare take another direction, for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place that would offer them the\neasiest access. The Scarecrow who led the walk finally discovered a large\ntree whose lower branches were spread wide enough to allow the small troop to pass. As he stepped under the branches, they twined themselves around him, and the next moment he was lifted from the ground and thrown head first among his companions. The Scarecrow was not hurt, except for a great deal of surprise, and he looked quite bewildered when Dorothy picked him up. The Lion called out to them: \"I have found another way.\" \"Let me try the first one,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for I am not afraid of somersaults.\" With that he went up to a tree; immediately the branches caught him and threw him away. \"How strange!\" exclaimed Dorothy. - The trees seem determined to fight us and interrupt our\njourney, remarked the Lion. - I will try in turn, said the Woodcutter. And with the axe\non his shoulder, he headed towards the first tree that had treated the Scarecrow so roughly. As a branch was already lowering itself to seize it, the Woodcutter struck it,\ncutting it clean. The tree began to shake all its branches, as if it were writhing\nin pain, but the Woodcutter passed safely. - Quick! he shouted to the others, come!\nThey rushed and slipped under the tree, all except Toto, caught in flight by\na small branch that shook him and made him howl in terror. But the Woodcutter,\nwith a blow of his axe, quickly freed the little dog. Inside the forest, the trees\nstood quietly. The travelers understood that only those on the edge could bend their branches; doubtless they were the sentinels of the forest, endowed\nwith a marvelous power to prevent strangers from entering. They thus reached\nthe other end of the forest easily. But to their great surprise, a high wall\nrose before them, which seemed to be made of white porcelain. It was smooth as a\nsaucer, and much higher than they were. -And now, said Dorothy, how\n62", "shall we go on? - I will make a ladder, answered the Woodcutter, because\nwe have no choice: we must climb this wall.\nCHAPTER 20: THE PORCELAIN LAND\nWhile the Woodcutter was making his ladder with wood from the forest, Dorothy lay down and fell asleep, tired from this long journey. The lion also curled up to sleep, and Toto lay down after him. The Scarecrow watched the Woodcutter at work. - I can't understand why this wall stands there, or what it is made of, he said to him. - Stop racking your brains and worrying\nabout this wall, answered the Woodcutter; we will see when we are\non the other side. After a while, the ladder was finished; it looked\nrickety, but the Woodcutter thought it was strong enough to serve their purpose. The Scarecrow woke Dorothy, the Lion, and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready.\nThen he climbed up first, but so clumsily that Dorothy had to follow and support him to prevent him from falling backwards. As soon as his head reached the top of the wall, he stopped: \"Ooooh!\" he said. \"Come on,\" urged Dorothy. The Scarecrow went forward and sat down on the edge; as soon as Dorothy's head had passed the crest of the wall: \"Ooooh!\" said the little girl, just as the Scarecrow had done. Then it was Toto's turn, who began to bark, but Dorothy calmed him down. The lion climbed up next,\nthen the Woodcutter, and both of them gave the same \"Ooooh!\" as soon as they had\nlooked over the wall. Sitting in a row on the ledge, they all gazed for a moment at the strange spectacle. At their feet stretched a land\nwith a ground as white, polished, and shiny as the bottom of a cake plate. Here and there stood\nhouses all made of porcelain and painted in the brightest colors. They\nwere very small, the tallest barely reaching Dorothy's waist.\nOne could still see cute little farms, surrounded by porcelain fences, and\ncows, sheep, horses, pigs, poultry, also made of porcelain, scattered around. But the most curious part of the spectacle was\nthe inhabitants of this strange country: milkmaids and shepherdesses dressed in shimmering bodices and skirts speckled with gold; princesses in long dresses of silver, gold, and purple; shepherds with breeches tied with pink, yellow, or blue braid, and gold buckles on their shoes; princes wearing crowns set with jewels, an ermine cloak thrown over their satin doublet; comic clowns with their cheeks painted with vermilion, their rumpled costumes, and their pointed hats. And\nwonder of wonders! all these people were made of porcelain, even their clothes, and so\nsmall that the tallest of them barely reached Dorothy's knee. At the start of the\n63", "but no one noticed the travelers, except a small purple porcelain dog,\nwith a flattened muzzle, who came to the foot of the wall to bark in a crystal-clear voice, before\nrunning off again. - How are we going to get down? asked Dorothy.\nThe ladder was too heavy indeed, they could not lift it; the Scarecrow let himself slide down the wall, and the others jumped on his body, to break their fall. Naturally, they took great care not to put their feet on his\nhead stuffed with pins. When they had all landed, they picked up the Scarecrow,\nand patted his straw, to restore his good shape. - We must cross this strange place, said Dorothy; it would not be wise to deviate from our path. So they entered the country of porcelain, and the first thing they\nmet was a milkmaid milking a cow. As they approached,\nthe cow gave an unexpected kick, knocking over the stool, the bucket, and the milkmaid herself, who fell to the ground with a great crash. Dorothy was very upset\nto see that the cow had broken a short leg, while the water lay in pieces, and that the poor milkmaid had a crack in her left elbow. \"There!\" cried the latter, angrily. \"Look what you have done! My cow has a broken leg, and I must take her to the mender, to have it glued back on. What possessed you to frighten my cow?\" \"I am very sorry,\" apologized Dorothy, \"I beg you to forgive us.\" But the pretty milkmaid was too offended\nto answer. Sulking, she picked up the broken leg, and dragged her poor\ncow, which was limping on its three legs. She walked away, casting reproachful glances over\nher shoulder at the clumsy strangers, and holding her cracked elbow close to her. This incident upset Dorothy. \"We must walk carefully,\" said the kind-hearted Woodcutter, \"or we risk\ndamaging these charming little people.\" A little further on, Dorothy saw a young Princess, magnificently dressed, who at the sight of these strangers, stopped,\nstunned, then ran away. Dorothy would have liked to admire her again and ran after her; but the porcelain girl began to cry: \"Stop chasing me! Stop chasing me!\" She seemed so frightened that Dorothy stopped and asked her: - Why? - Because, explained the Princess, I might\nfall while running and break myself. - But could you have it mended?\nasked the little girl. - Of course, retorted the Princess, my house is never so\npretty afterwards. - I believe you, said Dorothy. - Look at Mr. Pleasant, one of our\nclowns, continued the porcelain girl. He spends his time trying to stand on his head. He has broken so many times that he is glued back together from head to toe,\nit is not pretty at all. Here he comes, you can see for yourself. Indeed, a happy little clown came to meet them, and Dorothy could see that,\ndespite his pretty red, yellow and green clothes, he was covered in nasty cracks that\nran in all directions; it must have been patched up more than once.\nThe clown put his hands in his pockets, puffed out his cheeks and giggled, then, nodding\n64", "head towards the travelers, began to sing in an impertinent air: \"My darling young lady, Why open your eyes wide In front of old Mr. Pleasant? You look as stiff, As stiff and formal As if you had\nswallowed A poker!\" - Hold on tight, ordered the Princess; can't you see\nthat they are strangers? They must be treated with respect. - But it's respect, or\nI don't know anything about it, declared the clown. And he stood on his head. - Pay\nno attention to Mr. Pleasant, said the Princess to Dorothy. His head is all cracked,\nit makes him look strange, at times. - Oh, I don't pay him the slightest attention,\nsaid Dorothy. But you, you are so beautiful, that I could love you tenderly. Let me take you with me to Kansas, to put you on Aunt Em's mantel. I'll put you in my basket. \"That would make me very unhappy,\" replied the Porcelain Princess. \"You see, we live happily in our own country; here we can talk and move as we please. But if one of us is taken away, his limbs immediately stiffen; then he has nothing left to do but stand still in a graceful pose. No doubt that's all that's required of us when we decorate mantels, drawing rooms, and dressers, but our life is so much more pleasant here, in our own country!\" \"For nothing in the world would I make you unhappy,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Good-bye then!\" \"Good-bye!\" replied the Princess. They walked cautiously through the porcelain country. The little animals and people ran out of their way, for fear of being broken; after about an hour, the travellers reached the other side of the country, and found themselves again before a porcelain wall. However, this one was not as high as the first, and they managed to climb to the top of it by riding on the Lion's back. Then the Lion gathered himself up, and, relaxing his muscles, leapt over the wall; but in his leap, his tail struck a porcelain church which broke into a thousand pieces. \"That is very unfortunate,\" said Dorothy; allthese, wewerelucky,weonlybrokeonecowlegandonechurch.Theselittlepeoplearesofragile!-Terribly! saidtheScarecrow.Iamcongratulatingmyself,formyself,\nonbeingmadeofstraw.Iwouldnotbeeasilydamaged.ThereforethereisworsethanbeingaScarecrow.\nCHAPTER 21: THE LION BECOMES KING OF\nTHE ANIMALS\nOntheothersideoftheporcelainwall,thetravelersdiscoveredanunpleasantcountry,fullofpuddlesandswamps,andcoveredwithtallvegetationand\n65", "rigid. It was difficult to advance without stumbling in the muddy ruts, for the\nbushy stems prevented them from seeing where they were putting their feet. They managed, however, to make their way with difficulty and soon found firm ground again.\nThere the country seemed even wilder; after crossing a whole expanse of\nbrush and thickets, they finally arrived in a forest whose trees\nappeared to them the tallest and oldest they had ever seen. - This forest is\nabsolutely delightful, declared Lion, looking around him with pleasure; I have\nnever seen such a superb place. - It is dismal, said the Scarecrow. - Not at all,\nreplied the lion; I should like to live there the rest of my days. Look how\nsoft the dead leaves are to tread on, how thick and beautiful\ngreen the moss is on these old trunks. No wild beast could dream of a more\npleasant stay. - Perhaps there are wild beasts in this forest, said Dorothy. - I\nthink so, answered the Lion, but I don't want to. They walked in the forest\nuntil nightfall. Dorothy, Toto and the Lion lay down on the ground, while\nthe Woodcutter and the Scarecrow kept watch, as usual. In the\nmorning they set off again. Soon a low growl, made up of a thousand wild\ngrunts, reached their ears. Toto groaned a little, but the travelers continued fearlessly along the well-trodden path that led them to a clearing where hundreds of animals of all kinds were gathered. There were tigers, elephants, bears, wolves, foxes, and all those that can be seen in books of natural history. At that moment, Dorothy did not feel reassured. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a council, and from their way of growling and moaning, he judged that they must be in great embarrassment. Hearing his voice, some animals noticed him, and as if by magic, there was immediately a great silence in the assembly. The largest of the tigers approached the Lion, and after greeting him with respect, said to him: - Welcome, O King of the animals! You have come in time to\nfight our enemy, and bring peace to the inhabitants of this forest. -\nWhat afflicts you? asked the Lion, quietly. - A fierce enemy\nhas recently arrived in these woods, answered the Tiger, and is spreading terror\namong us. It is a frightful monster, resembling a giant spider, with a\nbody as big as an elephant, and eight immense arms, the length of a tree\ntrunk. It crawls through the forest, and when it captures an animal with one of its tentacles, it draws it to its mouth and swallows it up like a spider devouring a\nbutterfly. None of us will be safe while living with this horrible creature;\ntherefore we were taking counsel and seeking what measures to take, when\nyou came. The lion thought for a moment, then asked: - Are there other lions\nin this forest? - There were! but the monster devoured them all. Besides,\nnone of them matched your size and courage. - If I destroy your enemy, will you\nbow down before me, and obey me as the king of the forest? questioned-\n66", "gea the Lion. - With joy, answered the Tiger. - With joy! roared the other\nanimals in chorus. - So, where is your big spider hiding? asked the Lion. - Over there, among the oaks, said the Tiger, pointing his front paw in the direction.\n- I entrust my friends to you, and will go at once to slay the enemy. And the Lion\nsaid goodbye to his companions, and bravely set off to give battle to the monster. He\ndiscovered the big spider sleeping on the ground. It was so horrible\nthat its enemy turned away his muzzle in disgust. Its arms were really as\nlong as the Tiger had claimed. And its whole body was covered with black, shaggy hair. Its huge mouth was armed with a row of sharp teeth, a foot long. But its head was attached to its enormous body by a neck as thin as a wasp\u2019s waist. This peculiarity inspired the Lion with a good tactic to attack this creature. And as it was easier for him to fight it asleep than awake, he leapt forward, landed right on the monster\u2019s back, and with a blow of his heavy paw with sharp claws, decapitated the spider. Then he jumped to the ground, looked at the long arms and arms for a moment, and fell inert: the monster had lived. The Lion returned to the clearing where the animals were waiting for his return, and said\nproudly: -You have nothing more to fear from your enemy. Then the beasts bowed before the Lion as before their King, and he promised them to return to govern them, as soon as Dorothy had found a way to enter Kansas.\nCHAPTER 22: THE COUNTRY OF THE KOUADLINGZ\nHaving reached the other end of the forest without any problem, the travelers emerged from\nits darkness to find themselves at the foot of a hill with steep and rocky sides.\n- The climb is going to be tough, said the Scarecrow, but too bad; we must cross this hill. So he showed the way and the others followed. They had hardly reached the\nfirst rock when a hoarse voice shouted to them: - Get back! - Who are you? asked the Scarecrow. A head appeared behind the rocks and the same voice said: - This hill belongs to us, no one has the right to pass. - But we must pass,\ninsisted the Scarecrow. We want to go to the land of the Kouadlingz. - Well! you\nwill not go! replied the voice. And from behind the rock, a man came out, such as our\ntravelers had never seen before. Short and stocky, his body was surmounted\nby an enormous head, with a flattened skull, and supported by a strong, wrinkled neck. But this body was deprived of arms, and the Scarecrow concluded that such a helpless creature\ncould not prevent them from advancing. So he said: - Sorry to disturb you, but we\nmust cross your hill, whether you like it or not. And\nhe advanced boldly. Faster than lightning, the man's head flew off like\n67", "a stroke, its neck stretching until its flat skull struck the Scarecrow full in the body, and sent him rolling down the hill. As quickly as it had come, the head returned to its place and sneered: \"Not easy, eh?\" A chorus of mocking laughter rose from the hill, and Dorothy saw hundreds of armless Hammerheads standing behind every rock. These hoots, provoked by the Scarecrow's misfortune, made the Lion boil; with a roar of fury that rolled like thunder, he rushed to attack the hill. Again a Hammerhead whizzed by, and the great Lion rolled down the hill, as if carried by a cannonball. Dorothy ran up and helped the Scarecrow to his feet. The Lion joined her, still stunned and sore. - No use struggling with these front-strikers, he said, nothing could resist their fire. - But then,\nwhat to do? asked the little girl. - Call the Winged Monkeys, suggested the Woodcutter.\nYou have the right to summon them one last time. - Good idea, she replied.\nAnd putting the Golden Headdress on her head, she uttered the magic words. The Winged\nMonkeys did not wait any longer than usual, and the next moment, the whole troop\nwas standing before the child. - What do you order? asked the Monkey King, with a deep bow. - Take us over this hill, to the land of the Kouadlingz, replied the little girl. - It will be done, said the King. Immediately, the\nWinged Monkeys took the four travelers and Toto in their arms, and flew away.\nAs they passed over the hill, the Hammerheads, with howls of rage, threw their heads towards the sky, to reach the Monkeys, but in\nvain. Dorothy and her companions crossed the hill without harm, thanks to\ntheir rescuers who soon deposited them in the beautiful country of the Kouadlingz. -\nThis is the last time you summon us, said the King to Dorothy. Farewell then,\nand good luck! - Farewell, and a thousand thanks, said the little girl in return. The Winged Monkeys took flight and disappeared in the blink of an eye. The country of the Kouadlingz seemed prosperous and happy. Fields of ripe wheat followed fields of ripe wheat; well-paved roads marked them out, and pretty streams gurgled\nunder sturdy bridges. Fences, houses, and bridges were painted bright red,\njust as they were painted yellow in the land of the Ouinkiz, and blue in the land\nof the Muntchkinz. As for the Kouadlingz, little fat ones with a chubby, good-natured look,\nthey were also dressed all in red, which formed a brilliant contrast with\nthe green of the grass and the gold of the ears of corn. As the Monkeys had dropped them off not far from\na farm, the four travelers approached and knocked at the door. It was\nthe farmer's wife who came to open it, and when Dorothy asked for a little food,\nthe woman offered them all a good supper, accompanied by three kinds of cakes and\nfour kinds of petits fours, plus a bowl of milk for Toto. - Are we still far from Glinda's castle? the child asked. - Hardly any more, replied the\nfarmer's wife. Take the road south, and you will soon arrive there. They set off again after thanking the good woman; then they walked in the fields,\n68", "crossed some pretty bridges, and soon saw a magnificent castle rise up before them. The gates were guarded by three young girls, dressed in beautiful red uniforms, braided with gold; as Dorothy advanced, one of them asked her: - What do you come to seek in the land of the South? - I come to see the Good Witch who reigns here, she replied, can you take me to her? - Tell me first who you are, and I will ask Glinda if she agrees to receive you. So they named themselves, and the young girl in uniform entered the castle. She came back after a while to announce to them that they would be received presently. CHAPTER 23: GLINDA GRANTS DOROTHY\u2019S WISH\n\nBut before they could see Glinda, they took her to a room in the castle, where Dorothy could wash up and comb her hair. The Lion shook the dust from his mane, and while the Scarecrow was making himself look good, the Woodcutter polished his tin and oiled his knuckles. When they were presentable at last, they followed the girl soldier to the room where the\nGood Witch Glinda sat, on her throne of ubis. She seemed to them as young as she was beautiful.\nHer hair was a splendid red, streaming in curls over her shoulders. Her dress\nwas immaculate white, but her eyes were blue and rested kindly on the little girl. \"What can I do for you, my child?\" she asked.\n\nDorothy told the Witch her whole story: how she had been carried away to Oz, how she had met her friends, what wonderful\nadventures had befallen them. \"Now,\" she concluded, \"my greatest wish is to go home to Kansas, for Aunt Em must think\nsomething terrible has happened to me, and be worried to death. Now, unless\nthe crops have been better this year than last, that is more worry than Uncle Henry can afford.\" Glinda leaned forward to kiss the loving\nface that was raised to her. \"Rejoice, my dear child,\" she said, \"for I know\na way to get you back to Kansas.\" But, she added, you must give me the Golden Cap. - Willingly, exclaimed Dorothy, it is of no use to me now; while in your possession it will enable you to call the Winged Monkeys three times. - And I am just thinking of using their service three times, answered Glinda, smiling. Dorothy gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch asked the Scarecrow: - What are you going to do when Dorothy has left us? - I will return to the Emerald City, he answered, for Oz has put me in charge of it, and the people like me very much. Only one thing worries me: how to cross at 69", "Hammerhead Hill again? - With the help of the Golden Cap, I will order the\nWinged Monkeys to carry you to the entrance of the Emerald City, said Glinda. It\nwould be truly unforgivable to deprive this people of such an amazing leader. -\nAm I really amazing? asked the Scarecrow. - You are out of the ordinary,\nassured Glinda. Then turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked: - And\nwhat will happen to you when Dorothy has left the country? He leaned\non his axe to meditate for a moment, and answered: - The Yeinkiz have been very kind\nto me, they would have wanted me to govern them, when the Wicked Witch is\ndead. I love the Weinkiz very much, and if I could return to the West Country,\nnothing would please me more than to rule over them forever. - I will\norder the Winged Monkeys to carry you safe and sound to the land of the Weinkiz, that will be my\nsecond command, said Glinda. Your brain seems narrower, at first sight, than that of the Scarecrow. But to tell the truth, when you are well polished, you are\nmore brilliant than he, and I am sure that you will rule the Weinkiz with wisdom\nand kindness. Then the Witch turned to the big Lion and asked: - When Dorothy has gone home, what will become of you? - On the other side of the hill\nof the Hammerheads, he answered, lies a vast and old forest; all the beasts\nthat live there have acknowledged me as their King. If I could reach that forest, I\nwould live there very happily. -This will be my third commandment to the Winged Monkeys, said\nGlinda, they will carry you to your forest. Then, the magical powers\nof the Headdress will have been exhausted, I will give it to the Monkey Kings, so that he and his\npeople will be free forever. The Scarecrow, the Woodcutter, and the Lion expressed all their\ngratitude and thanked the Witch for her kindness; in turn, Dorothy exclaimed: -Certainly! you are as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet said\nhow I will return to Kansas. -Your Silver Shoes will carry you across the\ndesert, replied Glinda. If you had known their powers, you could have entered\nyour Aunt Em's house the first day you arrived in this country. - But then,\nI should not have my wonderful brains, cried the Scarecrow,\nand I should have lived all my life in the farmer's cornfield. - And I should not have my good heart,\nsaid the Tin Woodman, and I should have rusted there until the end of the world,\nin the forest. - And I should have always lived like a coward, declared Lion,\nand no beast in these woods would have found a kind word to say to me. - That is\nvery true, said Dorothy, and I am glad to have been of service to my good friends.\nBut now that each of them has what he most wanted in the world,\nand is happy to have a kingdom to rule, I think I should like to go back to Kansas. - The Silver Shoes, said the Good Witch, are endowed with magical virtues. One of their most astonishing effects is that they can transport you to any point on the earth in three steps, and each step is taken in the blink of an eye. You only have to tap your heels together three times, and order the Shoes to go where you wish. - If it is as simple as that, said Joyful-\n70", "ment the child, I will ask them to take me away to Kansas at once. She\nput her arms round the Lion\u2019s neck and kissed him, caressing his\nlarge head tenderly. Then she kissed the Woodcutter, who was weeping hot tears,\nat the great peril of his joints. She did not kiss the painted face of the Scarecrow, but hugged his soft straw carcass, and found that she herself was weeping\nat being obliged to leave her affectionate companions. Glinda the Good came down\nfrom her throne of derubis, gave the child a kiss good-bye, and Dorothy thanked him\nfor all the generosity she had shown to herself and her friends.\nThen she solemnly took Toto in her arms, and after a last farewell, she\nclicked the heels of her Shoes three times, ordering them\n- Take me back to Aunt Em\u2019s! The next moment she was whirling in the air,\nso lightly that she could only feel the wind whistling in her ears. The\nSilver Shoes took only three steps, and stopped so abruptly that the little girl\nrolled several times in the grass before she realized where she was. At last she\nsat up and looked around. \"Good heavens!\" she cried. She was sitting\nin the vast Kansas pasture, and in front of her stood the new farm that\nUncle Henry had built when the hurricane had blown away the old one. Uncle Henry\nwas milking the cows in the dairy. And Toto, who had jumped out of the little girl's arms, was running toward the farm, barking happily. Dorothy got up and found that she was in her socks. The Silver Shoes had fallen\nin its flight, and lay, lost forever, in the desert.\nCHAPTER 24: REUNION\nAunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages, when she\nlooked up and saw Dorothy running to her. \"My darling child!\" she cried, throwing her arms around the little girl and covering her face with kisses. \"For heaven's sake,\nwhere have you come from?\" \"From Oz,\" Dorothy answered gravely. \"And Toto is here,\ntoo. Oh, Aunt Em! how glad I am to be home again!\"\n71"]
